" The present invention provides a gaming device and in particular a bonus scheme of a gaming device that enables players to accumulate awards in a plurality of sets until one of the sets is completed. Each set includes at least one and preferably a plurality of components. The gaming device enables a player to pick a plurality of selections from a group of masked selections. Preferably, a component from one of the sets is associated with each selection. A component from two or more of, or each of the sets, could also be associated with a selection. 
 In the preferred embodiment, the components of a set include values, modifiers and bonuses; however, it should be appreciated that other components could be part of or associated with a set or a plurality of sets in addition to or in place of the values, modifiers and bonuses. At least one and preferably a plurality of designated or predetermined components are necessary to complete a set. For instance, in the preferred embodiment, each set has a plurality of value components. To complete such set, all of the value components in such set must be obtained or selected by the player. It should be appreciated that the number of or type of components in each set necessary to complete the set may vary and that the components necessary to terminate each set is preferably, but does not have to be, identical or similar. For example, a bonus component may be required to complete one of the sets. 
 Each component preferably has a symbol or other identifier associated with the component, and particularly the value components or the components necessary to complete a set. Thus, when the player picks one of the selections from the group of masked selections (which the game preferably simultaneously displays to the player), the game reveals the value and the identifier or symbol associated with one of the sets (i.e., to identify the component of the appropriate set). In one embodiment of the invention, an identifier or symbol is associated with a selection before a player picks from the group of masked selections. In another embodiment, the player picks the selection and then the symbol or identifier is associated with the selection before revealing the selection to the player. It should also be appreciated that the processor of the gaming device could randomly determine the selections. In accord with one aspect of the invention, the components are weighted such that the processor is more likely to assign one component to a selection over another component. 
 The player preferably receives the award associated with the first set completed; however, the player could receive an award from another completed set, such as the last set completed or from an uncompleted set. The award provided to the player is preferably based on the components of the appropriate set, such as the first set completed in the preferred embodiment. In the preferred embodiment, the award provided to the player includes the sum of the value components achieved, modified by any modifiers such as a multiplier (if any modifiers are obtained before the first set is completed) and the addition of any bonuses (if any bonuses are obtained before the first set is completed). 
 As indicated above, another aspect of the invention includes bonuses or bonus credits which are associated with the selections. If a player picks a selection and generates a bonus, the bonus is added to the designated set, a combination of the sets, or to all of the sets. 
 As also indicated above, in yet another aspect of the invention a modifier, such as a multiplier, is associated with one or more of the selections. If a player picks a selection, which includes a modifier, the modifier changes the value of a set based on the modifier. A modifier may be associated with any designated set, a combination of the sets, or all of the sets. 
 Although the present invention is discussed relative to a bonus game of a gaming machine, it should be appreciated that the present invention could be employed as a primary game in a gaming device. 
 It is therefore an advantage of the present invention to provide a gaming device having a plurality of potential award sets and a player obtains an award associated with one of the award sets.

" According to an aspect of this invention, a rotor assembly includes a substantially cylindrical support structure having at least one first region, and at least one second region. The rotor assembly further includes at least one rotor coil positioned within each first region of the substantially cylindrical support structure, with each rotor coil including a pair of distal end portions and a convex center portion, wherein the average mechanical density of the convex center portion is substantially equal to the average mechanical density of the distal end portions. Further, the average mechanical density of the first region is substantially equal to the average mechanical density of the second region. 
 One or more of the following features may also be included. One or more of the rotor coils includes a mandrel positioned within an interior region of the rotor coil. The mandrel may occupy a portion of the interior region of the rotor coil and is constructed of a material (e.g., stainless steel, copper, aluminum, phenolic, etc.) having a mechanical density that is greater than the average mechanical density of the first and second regions. The mandrel may occupy the interior region of the rotor coil and is constructed of a material (e.g., stainless steel, copper, aluminum, phenolic, etc.) having a mechanical density that is substantially equal to the average mechanical density of the first and second regions. 
 The mandrel includes a pair of distal end portions spaced by a pair of convex center portions. The periphery of the distal end portions of the mandrel may be defined by a first radius and the periphery of the convex center portions of the mandrel may be defined by a second radius, such that the second radius is larger than the first radius. Alternatively, the mandrel may be elliptical in shape. 
 One or more of the second regions may include a member that occupies a portion of the second region and has a mechanical density that is greater than the average mechanical density of the first and second regions. Alternatively, one or more of the second regions may include a member that occupies the second region and has a mechanical density that is substantially equal to the average mechanical density of the first and second regions. These members may be constructed of stainless steel, copper, aluminum, phenolic, etc. 
 The rotor coils (e.g., racetrack-type or saddle-type coils) may be superconducting coils and include one or more high temperature superconducting windings. These rotor coils, which may or may not be cryogenically cooled, generate a magnetic flux path within the rotor assembly during operation. The substantially cylindrical support structure may define an internal volume that houses a magnetic material having high saturation flux density, which is positioned within at least a portion of the flux path and decreases the overall reluctance of the flux path generated by the rotor coils. This magnetic material within the internal volume may or may not be cryogenically cooled. The conductors within the rotor coil may be wound such that the lines of magnetic flux produced by the rotor coil proximate the convex center portions of the mandrel are essentially radially aligned toward an axial center of the rotor assembly. 
 The saddle-type coil may be configured such that the lines of magnetic flux produced by the saddle-type coil are perpendicular with a surface of the substantially cylindrical support structure and radially aligned toward an axial centerline of the rotor assembly. 
 One or more advantages can be provided from the above aspects of the invention. The use of a convex or elliptical mandrel results in rotor coils that have consistent mechanical densities. Further, by matching the average mechanical density of the mandrel to that of the rotor coil, rotor performance can be enhanced. Additional enhancement can be obtained by matching the density of the filler material to that of the rotor coil/mandrel combination. By matching the density of the various components of the rotor assembly, the high speed operation of the rotor can be enhanced, as radial distortion due to centrifugal forces is reduced. Additionally, the use of a magnetic core within the cylindrical support structure of the rotor can enhance magnetic performance by reducing reluctance. 
 The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.

" The present invention is concerned with functional variants of protein C, that contain a modified Gla-domain and exhibit enhanced anticoagulant activity. This enhanced anti-coagulant activity of the present protein C its emanates essentially from enhanced calcium and/or membrane binding properties and is mainly expressed by APC, which is the active form of the protein C zymogen, said zymogen being virtually inactive. Accordingly, the present invention is also concerned with variants of APC that contain a modified Gla-domain and exhibit enhanced anticoagulant activity. The Gla-domain comprises the first amino-terminal 45 residues of protein C and its structure and function will be discussed in more detail below. 
 According to the present invention it has been discovered that introduction of at least one, suitably a few, e.g. at least 6, and more specifically 7 or more, amino acid residue modification(s) into the Gla-domain, provides protein C or APC variants that have improved properties as compared to the variants having modifications in the Gla-domain that have been reported by Shen et al. (loc. cit.) and in the WO 99/20767 publication. 
 Suitably, the present variants do not contain more than 10 amino acid modifications and, suitably, do not encompass hybrids between different vitamin K-dependent proteins, such as hybrid protein C variants having a Gla-domain derived from prothrombin or Factor X, unless the differences between this other Gla-domain and the Gla-domain of protein C only constitute a few amino acid residues as discussed above. 
 Protein C variants according to the present invention that display improved properties, such as further enhanced anticoagulant activity, could provide benefits, e.g. by lowering the dosage or frequency of administration when used for therapeutic purposes. 
 The present invention is also concerned with methods to produce such variants based on DNA technology, with DNA segments intended for use in said methods, and with use of said variants for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes.

" An object of the present invention is to provide a printer with a cutter and a method for cutting a recording paper that are capable of preventing wide lines having higher density from being recorded on the recording paper by stopping the recording paper to cut the same. 
 The above object is achieved by countervailing the decrease of the front tension caused by a curl formed on the continuous recording paper between tension rollers and paper discharge rollers. 
 The tension rollers are disposed at the downstream side of the print head and transport the recording paper applying a predetermined tension to the part of the recording paper having been recorded by a print head. The paper discharge rollers are disposed between the tension rollers and the cutter and transport the recording paper to the cutter. The paper discharge rollers stop rotating when a cutting line on the recording paper reaches the cutter. Owing to the stop of the paper discharge rollers, a curl of the recording paper is formed between the tension rollers and the paper discharge rollers. The curl generates a reactive force that pushes the recording paper back to the tension rollers by the elasticity of the recording paper and decreases the front tension. 
 A preferable embodiment of the present invention equalizes the front tension to the recording paper when the paper discharge rollers stops rotating with it when the paper discharge rollers rotates, by increasing torque of the tension rollers when the paper discharge rollers stops rotating. Another preferable embodiment of the present invention provides a reactive force absorbing device between the tension rollers and the paper discharge rollers. The reactive force absorbing device absorbs the reactive force caused by the curl that acts on the recording paper to decrease the front tension. The reactive force absorbing device includes a dancer roller biased by a spring. It is desirable to increase the torque of the tension roller in combination with using the reactive force absorbing device. 
 According to the present invention, the decrease of the front tension caused by the curl is countervailed, since the torque of the tension rollers is increased and/or the recording paper is pushed in the direction enlarging the curl at least while the paper discharge rollers stop rotating. Thereby, the front tension is maintained at approximately the same level, regardless of the rotation or the stop of the paper discharge rollers. Thus, it prevents wide lines as uneven density from being printed on the recording paper.

a tension roller disposed at the downstream side of said print head, for transporting said recording paper applying front tension to said recording paper when said print head is recording the frames on said recording paper; 
a paper discharge roller disposed between said tension roller and said cutter, for transporting said recording paper having passed said tension roller to said cutter, and for stopping rotating to form a curl of said recording paper between said tension roller and said paper discharge roller when said cutter is cutting said recording paper; and 
a torque control device for applying large torque to said tension roller while said paper discharge roller is stopped, said torque control device equalizing said front tension when said discharge roller stops to said front tension when said paper discharge roller rotates."

" In accordance with the present invention, the above and other problems are solved by a low cost Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag having a Radio Frequency (RF) mode for transmitted signals coupled with an optical or ultrasonic secondary mode of communication and/or triggering. This combination of dual mode communications allows long range and autonomous tracking of objects to be realized through the RF transmit mode while providing the local communication (transfer) of data simultaneously through the secondary mode of communication. The ability to communicate through optical or ultrasonic secondary mode means that radio silence can be maintained (such as when on aircraft) while the total tag functionality of data transfer can be accomplished through the secondary mode. It also means that a tag can be triggered to transmit the RF signal on a discriminatory basis. 
 Another aspect of the present invention relates to methods and systems for transferring data wirelessly that eliminates the requirement for a resonator or other accurate time reference to control the timing of the input or output data pulse train. Elimination of this control element permits the RFID tag to operate with its associated reader in the presence of temperature induced variations in the control timing. 
 Embodiments of the invention may be implemented as a computer process, a computing system or as an article of manufacture such as a computer program product or computer readable media. The computer program product may be a computer storage media readable by a computer system and encoding a computer program of instructions for executing a computer process. The computer program product may also be a propagated signal on a carrier readable by a computing system and encoding a computer program of instructions for executing a computer process.

" In the preferred embodiment, a hard disk unit includes a disk, a controller microprocessor, a host bus interface, a buffer memory, a buffer memory controller, and a disk formatter. Write operations are received by the bus interface, and the corresponding write operation data for each write operation is stored in a circular buffer in the buffer memory. The buffer memory controller implements the circular buffer and controls read and write access to the buffer memory. When write operation data arrives, the buffer memory controller stores the data contiguously within the circular buffer in the relative order in which the operation was received by the hard disk unit. 
 Upon receiving a command from the microprocessor, in the typical case, the buffer memory controller transfers the data of a write operation from the buffer memory to the disk formatter, which formats the data and writes it to the disk. In one embodiment, the buffer controller will continue transferring data from the circular buffer even after the data of the first write operation has been written to disk. The buffer controller supplies the data, operation by operation, in the order in which it was received by the hard disk unit. The microprocessor can simply issue commands to the disk formatter to continue writing the data of the subsequently received operations. 
 In the preferred embodiment, the buffer memory controller also includes a set of address registers and a set of block count registers. These registers allow the buffer controller to transfer the data of several operations from the buffer memory in an order other than that in which the commands were received, using only a single command from the microprocessor. 
 In a preferred method, the microprocessor loads the address registers with the addresses within the buffer memory of the data of two or more write operations. The microprocessor loads the block count registers with the size, in blocks, of the corresponding operations. The microprocessor then issues a single command to the buffer memory controller to transfer the data identified by the address registers and block count registers from the buffer memory to the disk formatter. The buffer controller first transfers the data identified by the first address and block count register, then the second address and block count register, and so on. The address registers and block count registers enable the buffer memory controller to access the data of the write operations from the circular buffer in any order, regardless of the order in which the data is placed in the buffer. 
 The microprocessor is typically not fast enough to issue a second or additional commands to the buffer controller in time to supply the data for a second or additional operations without losing a revolution of the disk in the meantime. Typically, by the time the microprocessor sets up the buffer memory controller and issues the additional command, the sector to be written has passed the write head and a revolution of the disk is lost. In accordance with the preferred embodiment, however, two or more write operations to the same track may be completed during a single revolution of the disk, even if the operations are received in an order other than the order in which they must be written to the disk.

This approach allows us to “hide” refresh cycles and memory update cycles in a normal memory operation. The resulting memory device is as friendly as existing SRAM device. In fact, a memory of this invention can be made fully compatible with existing SRAM device. 
 (5) All of the above improvements are achieved by using much lower power than the power used by prior art DRAM's.

" As described above, in the monopulse system, the detecting range is broadened by widening the angle of the antenna beam. However, a widen angle of the antenna beam inevitably brings an increase in unnecessary sidelobes (subbeams of weaker intensity radiating in different directions from the main beam) The sidelobes cause leaks of unnecessary waves from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antennas, which would bring a deterioration in azimuth accuracy and an increase in wrong detections. 
 The unnecessary waves leak via two routes. On one route, reflected waves returning after being Doppler-shifted by an obstacle are diffracted at an edge of a plate (conductor plate) which fixes the antennas and serves to ground the antennas are received by the receiving antennas. On the other route, the reflected waves are received by a transmitting antenna, and part of them are reflected due to mismatching within the transmitting antenna to be radiated again to leak to the receiving antennas. 
 In the monopulse system, because the azimuth of the obstacle is determined according to the amplitude and phase of receive signals, the problem noted above leads to significant deterioration of the azimuth accuracy and wrong detection. 
 An object of the present invention is to obviate the problem noted above and to provide a low-cost, compact and light-weight automotive radar that excels in azimuth accuracy over a wide detectable range. 
 The problem the present invention addresses can be effectively solved by providing a diffracted wave prevention structure at edges, at least partly, of the top face of a grounding conductor plate which grounds antennas in an automotive radar to be mounted on a mobile object, such as a wheeled vehicle, to detect the azimuth of an obstacle, its distance from the mobile object and relative speed. The diffracted wave prevention structure may comprise, for instance, a radio wave absorber covering the top face edges at least in part and arranged on the top face of the grounding conductor plate, because the use of such means can prevent diffracted waves from being generated at the edges of the grounding conductor plate, and unnecessary waves can be thereby prevented from leaking to the receiving antennas, accordingly to achieve a high level of azimuth accuracy. 
 It is preferable to provide a radio wave absorber between the transmitting antenna and the receiving antennas. This arrangement can prevent leaks from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antennas, resulting in a high level of azimuth accuracy. 
 Further, by configuring the radio wave absorber of a sponge material containing radio wave absorbing grains, the automotive radar can be easily produced in light weight and at low cost. 
 Also, by fitting in advance the radio wave absorber to a radome (a protective cover for the radar) covering the front of the antennas, the number of assembling processes can be reduced. 
 Further by so selecting the height of the radio wave absorber from the top face of the antennas as to prevent radio waves from radiating, or arriving from, outside the range of obstacle detecting angles, diffracted waves can be prevented from leaking from the grounding edge or leaks from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antennas can be prevented, resulting in a further contribution to azimuth accuracy improvement. 
 Also, by having the transmitting antenna protrude farther ahead than the receiving antennas, leaks from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antennas can be prevented, resulting in a further enhanced level of azimuth accuracy. 
 These and other objects and many of the attendant advantages of the invention will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings.

" In one aspect of the invention, the present invention provides a disk drive having timing marks (TMs) within timing sections of disk tracks, with reduced probability of missing or misidentifying TMs in operation. More specifically, the disk drive searches for TMs on the disk within an TM search window which extends past the TM on the disk, which reduces the probability of missing an TM due to misalignment of the TM search window with respect to the TM. 
 TM patterns for use with embodiments of the present invention are preferably chosen to reduce the probability of misidentification of an TM in the presence of read errors. More specifically, an n-bit TM is preferably chosen to maintain a maximal post-shift sliding distance d2 for m post-shifts of the TM pattern relative to the input stream, where m is selected to correspond to the nominal boundary of the TM search window. In this manner, the probability of a misidentification of the TM due to a post-shift having a small Hamming distance from the TM pattern may be reduced. In addition, the TM pattern maintains a selected pre-shift sliding distance d1 for n pre-shifts of the TM pattern relative to the input stream. 
 In a preferred embodiment, the timing marks are-servo timing marks (STMs), and are followed by servo position information. Recognition of the STMs enables the servo position information to be used to control the head position during disk operation. In an alternate preferred embodiment, the timing marks are data timing marks (DTM), and are followed by data. Recognition of the DTMs facilitates byte synchronization of data.

" Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to intravaginal devices containing progesterone that can be used as an estrus inductor in an organism, such as bovine, swine, equine, and the like. Further, embodiments of the present invention generally relate to processes of manufacture and use of said devices. Embodiments of the new devices of the present invention generally include the following characteristics, either alone or in combination: 



 a) An intravaginal anchoring structure. In various embodiments the anchoring structure comprises a cruciform and/or elastically deformable body, optionally with blind tubular branches defining a continuous inner duct connected to the outside through transversally-placed holes located along said tubular structure. 
 b) A nylon insert on said inner duct. In various embodiments, whose cross section together with the cross section of the inner duct define a free space along its surface. 
 c) A chamber located in the inner part of said cruciform body and, in various embodiments, connected to the outside by means of a hole. 
 d) In various embodiments, the anchoring structure consists of a phenyl-vinyl-silicone matrix reticulated with peroxide and homogeneously impregnated with about 1 g natural progesterone. 




 e) In a most preferred embodiment, but not meant as a limitation, the physical dimensions of the anchoring structure, free from substantial impregnation with progesterone, are as follows:  



















Volume:
 25 cm3 +/− 1.5 cm3



External area:
135 cm2 +/− 5%



Internal area:
 92 cm2 + − 5%



Total area:
230 cm2 +/− 5%










 An embodiment of a device according to the present invention illustrates considerable differences as compared to prior art devices. 
 For example, a comparison of progesterone release curves with device insertion times illustrates that various prior art CIDR devices (with 1.9 g of progesterone) produce plasma progesterone concentrations that cannot be quantified until hours after the application of the device, in some cases, whereas embodiments of the present invention (with 1 g of progesterone) produce progesterone levels of 3 to 4 ng/ml in as little as 0.5 hours after device application, in most cases. 
 Various embodiments of a device of the present invention are made from a phenyl-vinyl-silicone reticulated with a peroxide curing technique. Various processes of these embodiments require only a second-order reaction, with slower curing times. Since the reaction speed is slower, the silicone reticulation level can be easily controlled, resulting in a mesh with enough flexibility and elasticity to facilitate progesterone spreading towards the surface of various embodiments of the present invention, while retaining adequate mechanical properties, such as rigidity. 
 As a result of improved flexibility and elasticity of peroxide-reticulated matrices, the progesterone spreading speed increases and allows for impregnation of the device with a smaller drug amount. 
 Another improvement found in various embodiments of the present invention is that the presence of holes connecting with the inner duct and the external surface allows progesterone to spread by following two alternative paths: (1) towards the external surface of the device; and, (2) towards the internal surface of the inner duct, from which the progesterone may spread along the inner duct towards communicating holes and through them to the outside or exterior of the device whereas the prior art CIDR devices only allow progesterone to spread towards the external surface. 
 A further improvement of various embodiments of the present invention is that at least one branch or at least one portion is larger than the respective portion or branch. By respective portion and/or branch is meant the branch and/or portion that extends from the intersection of the middle portion and the respective branch and/or portion. Such an arrangement allows a better anchor in the vaginal duct and/or more security in terms of any possible displacement of the device towards the outside during use/application. This improved rigidity in the side branches of the longitudinal shaft is accompanied by a higher flexibility in the opposing side branches. Further, the particular rigidity and flexibility of the present invention can be regulated through modification of the nylon core and/or curing processes. 
 Other embodiments of the present invention may also include at least one chamber inside or within the exterior of the device that is connected to the outside by means of a hole and/or passage which may be optionally sealable. A chamber of such embodiments may be utilized to contain supplementary additives to be used with the device, such as hormones, drugs, antiseptics, lubricants, and the like. 
 Further included within the scope of the present invention are processes related to estrus synchronization and processes for manufacture of various embodiments of the present invention.

an intravaginal anchoring system comprising a middle portion, a first opposing portion, a second opposing portion, a first branch and a second branch wherein the first and second opposing portions extend from the middle portion and the first branch extending from the first opposing portion and the second branch extending from the second opposing portion; 
a chamber located within the middle portion; 
at least one hole in at least one of the first opposing portion, the second opposing portion, the first branch and/or the second branch; and,

The particular voltage being at a specific value such that input transistors within the input buffer do not experience overstress voltages. Generally, overstress voltages are voltages having values higher than the internal voltage of a Ring I/O wherein the input buffer is located. Optionally, p-supply can be prevented from supplying current to the input buffer when an input voltage to the input buffer is HIGH. Also optionally, a generator can be used to design the voltage tolerant I/O. 
 In an additional embodiment, a voltage tolerant circuit for protecting an input buffer is disclosed. The voltage tolerant circuit includes an n-channel pass gate transistor having a first terminal coupled to a pad I/O, a second terminal coupled to the input of an input buffer, and a gate coupled to an internal ring voltage (Ring VDD). In addition, a p-supply p-channel transistor is included that has a gate coupled to the pad I/O, a first terminal coupled to Ring VDD, and a second terminal coupled to a p-supply of the input buffer. As above, the p-supply is a voltage supplied to a p-channel transistor in the input buffer. In one embodiment, an additional p-channel transistor and n-channel transistor can be included to prevent the p-supply from becoming too low. For example, a p-channel transistor can be included that has a first terminal coupled to the pad I/O, a gate coupled to Ring VDD, and a second terminal coupled to a first terminal of an n-channel transistor. The n-channel transistor can include a gate coupled to Ring VDD and a second terminal coupled to the p-supply of the input buffer. As above, the voltage tolerant I/O can be designed using a generator. 
 A voltage tolerant architecture is disclosed in a further embodiment of the present invention. The voltage tolerant architecture includes an input buffer and a voltage tolerant I/O circuit. The input buffer includes an input, an output, and a p-supply. As above, the p-supply is a voltage supplied to a p-channel transistor in the input buffer. The voltage tolerant I/O circuit includes an n-channel pass gate transistor having a first terminal coupled to a pad I/O and a second terminal coupled an input of an input buffer. In addition, a p-supply p-channel transistor is included in the voltage tolerant I/O circuit that has a gate coupled to the pad I/O, a first terminal coupled to Ring VDD, and a second terminal coupled to the p-supply of the input buffer.

" In a first aspect, the invention is directed to a female condom having a highly elastic resilient pouch portion that is able to freely stretch or extend from an original contracted or compacted configuration into an elongated or stretched configuration, and then return under resilient urging to the original contracted configuration. The pouch may be fashioned with regular circular convolutions that act in a spring-like manner for biasing the condom in a longitudinal direction so that the condom will automatically move back into the contracted configuration. In addition, elastic biasing members or strips may be incorporated into the construction of the condom for providing or augmenting the longitudinal spring-like action of the condom. Thus, the pouch of the condom in one embodiment may be a bunched-up pouch having one or more elastic biasing members attached for retaining the condom in a contracted condition. Alternatively, the pouch may be a smooth pouch made of highly resilient natural latex having high elongation characteristics so that the pouch has sufficient spring bias along the length of the pouch to return the condom to its original configuration and position. 
 In an additional aspect, the condom of the invention may include a contoured V-shaped or triangular outer frame which also has a spring bias incorporated. Thus, the outer frame may include a curved or dome-like shape which enables the frame to flex so as to better stay in contact with the vulva or external anatomy of the female when the pouch of the condom is located in the vagina. The frame is contoured in a concave fashion on the side that contacts the area of the female anatomy surround the vagina. The V-shaped outer frame is sufficiently resilient to flatten out during penetration by the male to provide more intimate contact during intercourse, and then return to its original curved shape following withdrawal. 
 In yet another aspect, the condom of the invention includes a retention means located at the closed end of the pouch. The retention means of the invention is preferably a sponge which serves to anchor the closed end of the pouch in the vagina. The sponge may be circular or any other desired shape, and can have a diameter larger than, equal to, or smaller than the pouch portion. Advantageously, the sponge is retained within the pouch in a cavity formed at the end of the pouch by a restricted neck which retains the sponge in the cavity. The sponge can also serve as a resilient spring-like member in addition to or in place of the pouch. Thus, the sponge may be made thick in the longitudinal direction, such as one-half to two inches in thickness, so as to collapse when contacted by the penis, and then rebound upon withdrawal. In addition, the sponge may include an insertion opening for receiving a finger of a user to facilitate insertion of the condom into the vagina. Accordingly, a separate applicator is not required for insertion of the condom of the invention into a vagina. These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments.
","1. A female condom comprising: 
a pouch having a closed end and an open end, said pouch being constructed to reside in a contracted configuration when said condom is deployed in a vagina, said pouch further being able to resiliently extend longitudinally from said contracted configuration to an elongated configuration when a penis is inserted into said condom, and said pouch including a longitudinal biasing means for returning said pouch to said contracted configuration following removal of the penis."

 In one embodiment, the present invention comprises an injection device comprising a receptacle or container for an active substance, which is connected to an injection needle and is accommodated inside a sliding sleeve that can be displaced within a housing by means of a driving force. A sleeve-shaped needle-protecting device is displaceable within the housing by means of a spring such that said needle-protecting device moves forward and extends past the injection needle in an axial direction when the injection needle is withdrawn from the body tissue. A lock prevents the needle-protecting device from being manually pushed backward, the lock effective between the needle-protective device and the sliding sleeve, and being automatically deactivated when the sliding sleeve is at least approximately back in its retracted position. 
 An embodiment of the invention is characterized in that the receptacle is accommodated inside a sliding sleeve, which during the skin penetration is shifted in the housing from a retracted position into an advanced position, that the needle protecting device in its advanced position is automatically locked by locking means, which are arranged and designed such that they are operative between the needle protecting device and the sliding sleeve when the needle protecting device and the sliding sleeve are located in their advanced position, and that means for disengaging the locking means are present, which disengaging means are operative when the sliding sleeve is located at least approximately in its retracted position. 
 The needle protecting device is thus not, as in many known devices of this type, locked against the housing, but rather the sliding sleeve, and the means for disengaging the locking mechanism are operative only when the sliding sleeve is located at least approximately in its retracted position. This provides the advantage that the injection needle is already situated again inside the housing when the locking mechanism is disengaged. Consequently, in any operating state of the autoinjector it is ensured that the injection needle cannot be unintentionally touched. 
 According to a further embodiment of the invention, the locking means displays at least one flexible tongue that is arranged on the sliding sleeve and is oriented in an essentially axial manner, which flexible tongue, in its relaxed state, forms an axial stop with a region of the needle protecting device. Further, the means for disengaging the locking mechanism display an inward-jutting projection arranged in the housing, which projection in the retracted position of the sliding sleeve presses the flexible tongue in a radially-inward manner, in such a way that the part of the sliding sleeve containing the flexible tongue can slip into the region of the needle protecting device. Through these measures, an autoinjector can be realized in a simple and cost-effective manner and, moreover, has a relatively short structural length. 
 According to another embodiment of the invention, a spring element is present which presses the needle protecting device into its advanced position and which is stressed by the sliding sleeve when the latter moves into its advanced position. This has the advantage that the needle protecting device is not pushed in the direction of the skin of the patient until the needle is stuck in. 
 A further embodiment of the invention provides for the presence of carrier means that cause the needle protecting device to be carried along by the sliding sleeve when the latter is guided from its advanced position into the retracted position. It is thus no longer necessary to manually push the needle protecting device back into the housing after unlocking has taken place. If, in addition, a restoring spring is provided, which acts on the sliding sleeve with a restoring force in the direction of its retracted position, then both the sliding sleeve and the needle protecting device automatically assume the retracted starting position when the driving force ceases.
","1. A device for injecting an active substance, comprising an injection needle, a housing, a receptacle for the active substance, a syringe piston displaceable in the receptacle for the purpose of expelling the active substance, and a needle protecting device displaceable relative to the housing, wherein, during a skin penetration of the injection needle, the needle protecting device remains in a substantially constant position relative to the housing and in the process a spring element is stressed, wherein, after the removal of the injection needle from the skin, the spring element pushes the needle protecting device into an advanced position in which the needle is covered."

" A dynamic self-configuring system for collecting meter data is disclosed herein. In an illustrative embodiment, a plurality of meter devices, which operate to track usage of a service or commodity such as, for example, electricity, water, and gas, are operable to wirelessly communicate. One of the meter devices, which is referred to as a collector, broadcasts messages to identify one or more of the meters with which it can successfully communicate. A qualification process is used to determine which meters are able to communicate successfully with the collector. The qualification process compares information about the quality of the communication between the collector and a given meter with a threshold value. If the quality of the communication satisfies this threshold requirement, then the meter is identified as a level one meter and is registered as such with the collector. The collector maintains data designating all of the identified level one meters. 
 The collector then communicates instructions to the level one meters to scan for meters that are operable to successfully communicate with the level one meters. A similar qualification process is used to identify such meters. Meters that meet the threshold criterion for successful communications are then designated as level two meters and are registered as such with the collector. Data identifying the level two meters and the communication path from the collector to the level two meters is stored on the collector and the level two meters. 
 The collector continues the process of scanning the last defined level of meters for new meters that communicate with the last defined level. This process gradually provides identification of the meters in the network and the specific paths through the various levels that the collector uses to communicate with each meter. Additionally, when new meters are added to the network, they are identified via subsequent scans. 
 According to another feature of the invention, the threshold values that are used during the qualification process to identify which meters satisfy the criterion for registration at a given level can be dynamically adjusted. 
 Other features and advantages of the invention may become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention and accompanying drawings.

" Accordingly, a field effect transistor is formed with an extra-doped channel region for preventing undesired body effect. 
 For fabricating a field effect transistor, an extra-doped channel region is formed below a surface of a semiconductor substrate. An opening is formed in the semiconductor substrate into the extra-doped channel region. A gate insulator is formed at walls of the opening such that the extra-doped channel region abuts the gate insulator at a bottom portion of the opening. The opening is filled with a gate electrode. 
 In one embodiment of the present invention, the extra-doped channel region abuts the gate insulator at a bottom wall and sidewalls of the opening below a half-height of the opening. In another embodiment of the present invention, the opening is formed after the extra-doped channel region is formed. In addition, a drain and a source are formed in the semiconductor substrate to the sides of the opening with an overlap under the gate insulator and the gate electrode. 
 In a further embodiment of the present invention, the conductivity type of a dopant within the extra-doped channel region is opposite to a respective conductivity type of a respective dopant in each of the drain, the source, and the gate electrode. In another embodiment of the present invention, a respective line pad is formed on each of the drain and the source. 
 In an example application, the field effect transistor is formed as part of a DRAM (dynamic random access memory) cell. In that case, the respective line pad disposed on the source is coupled to a storage capacitor of the DRAM cell, and the gate electrode forms a word line for the DRAM cell. However, the field effect transistor of the present invention may be applied for other types of integrated circuits. 
 In this manner, because the extra-doped channel region abuts the gate insulator at walls of the opening of the recessed type field effect transistor, body effect is prevented. Thus, the field effect transistor has a more stable threshold voltage for more stable operation.

" In accordance with this need, the invention is generally realized in a system for retrieving information from a document. The system includes a document model having a plurality of data structures representative of the components within the document and a thumbnail image registered with the document model. The registration is accomplished by mapping selected coordinates within the thumbnail image to a data structure selected from the plurality of data structures.

","1. A system for linking to a document, comprising: 
a document model, representative of the document, having a plurality of data structures representative of components within the document; and 
a thumbnail image registered with the document model such that selected coordinates within the thumbnail image are each mapped to a data structure selected from the plurality of data structures."
" In view of the foregoing, in accordance with the invention as embodied and broadly described herein, a method and apparatus are disclosed in one embodiment of the present invention as including an integrated cleaning system comprising a cleanser, collector, and controller. The cleanser may condition and distribute cleaning fluids such as detergents and heated water for dissolving, trapping in solution, or otherwise lifting grime (e.g. dirt, debris, oil, etc.) from the surface being cleaned. The collector may extract (e.g. vacuum) the soiled cleaning fluids from the surface. The controller may monitor and control the operation of the cleanser and collector. 
 In selected embodiments, a cleaner may include a heater for heating one or more cleaning fluids before they are transported to a wand for application to the surface being cleaned. Suitable heaters may include heat exchangers, electric heaters, gas heaters, and the like. In some embodiments, the cleanser may heat the cleaning fluids (e.g. water) under pressure to increase their boiling temperature. This may permit the cleaning fluids to have greater thermal energy when applied to the surface. 
 In general, the hotter the cleaning fluids, the better and faster the cleaning. For example, the hotter the water used, the less chemical detergents are needed. Certain embodiments in accordance with the present invention may apply water at temperatures range from about 48° C. and about 121° C., or even greater. To maintain the cleaning fluids at the desired temperature at distant locations, the cleaner may recirculate cleaning fluid through the heater. Moreover recirculation conduits and wand conduits may be insulated to reduce heat loss. 
 A collector in accordance with the present invention may utilize deep vacuum pumps. In general, deeper vacuums extract the cleaning fluids and dirt better than lower vacuums. As a result, a deeper vacuum generally shortens drying times. Additionally, cleaning fluids will evaporate at a lower temperature under vacuum. Selected collectors in accordance with the present invention may pull a vacuum of 25.4 cm Hg or greater. 
 In certain embodiments, a separator may remove the large majority of the liquid from the flow before it reaches the vacuum pump. In some embodiments, the separator may enforce a centrifugal acceleration greater than gravitational acceleration to effect the separation. 
 Deep vacuum pumps typically have close tolerances that must be protected from the debris and moisture picked up during the cleaning process. In certain embodiments, one or more filters may be positioned in the flow between the separator and the vacuum pump in order to mitigate the debris and moisture. 
 After being separated from the flow of air, waste (e.g., water, trash, dirt, foam, chemicals, and the like) may be stored in a storage tank. In certain embodiments, such storage may be contained within the separator itself. In other embodiments, an additional tank or tanks may be employed to store the waste as needed. 
 The novel systems in accordance with the present invention may further include a discharge system allowing for continuous operation. That is, removal of the waste liquids without shutting down the collector. By operating selected valves (manually, mechanically, or under computer control), one volume may be taken off-line and emptied while another continues to collect liquids. 
 Integrated cleaning systems in accordance with the present invention may be operated manually, mechanically, or by computer. In selected embodiments, a controller may facilitate computer control of the system. For example, a controller may include a programmable logic controller (PLC) programmed to facilitate the various valve openings and closings that may be needed to accomplish continuous operation of a collector. Swapping collection volumes may be programed or arranged to occur automatically when certain liquids levels are achieved. Moreover, various sensors and actuators may inform an operator of maintenance needs, low levels, low temperatures, high temperatures, low vacuum, high vacuum, and other system issues that may require attention. 
 In selected embodiments of the present invention, multiple cleaning stations (e.g. multiple wands) may be run with one integrated cleaning system in accordance with the novel concept of the present invention. Cleaning systems of the present invention may be applied to large and small detail shops, car dealers, semi-truck detail shops, gas stations, self-serve car washes, bus washes, rental car agencies, and large companies with an automobile fleet. Moreover, the present invention may be applied to cleaning applications unrelated to automobiles. For example, an integrated cleaning system may be used in furniture refurbishing, commercial carpet cleaning, and the like.

" This invention, called “RADAR™,” which stands for “Radiology Alert and Data Accrual Registry,” is an interactive web-based software solution and application service provider (ASP) program, designed to enable instant notification and alert responses from busy physicians, healthcare providers, and other professionals. The RADAR system is a complete risk management program for healthcare and other communication solutions, providing alert and data management and tracking for important data for physicians and other professionals. 
 Through the normal process of dictating an examination, reading a study, or performing a diagnostic test, the RADAR system can be implemented in a matter of seconds, notifying the ordering practitioner of important test results. In a preferred embodiment, the method of activation involves a click or clicks of a mouse, function key, or a simple voice recognition sequence to automatically enter a follow-up request. As an example, the simplified invocation might be interpreted to mean “RADAR ALERT 1” which, in turn, may be indicative of an urgent finding that would require notification to a referring physician within a particular time period. The request is preferably transmitted to a call-center (that can be located anywhere in the world) where a person follows up with the request. The result is a seamless, closed-loop and documented communication which is retrievable at a later date to prove that the communication took place and the content thereof. This efficiency makes the system usable to a wide variety of providers who do not have the time or inclination to use more cumbersome, commercially available systems. 
 RADAR also allows tracking of important test results, including data-tracking for JACHO inspections and MQSA mammography compliance programs. In the RADAR system, important data can be tabulated, stored and tracked for future reference. This comprehensive system allows for easy generation of data for institutional compliance and quality assurance. RADAR also allows for computerized notification of follow-up recommendations to both the patient and referring healthcare provider. All electronic communications are stored in the RADAR database for future reference. 
 In terms of a specific implementation, the system preferably using the following, through changes will no doubt be made as technology progresses: 



 PC-based format 
 Microsoft Windows-based operating system 
 HL-7 Interface 
 Compatible with current HIS/RIS systems (i.e. Cerner) 
 Compatible with voice recognition software (i.e. Powerscribe)

" Embodiments of the present invention are directed to a method and system for locating an RF transponder. In one embodiment the method includes transmitting from a source to a multi-channel receiver a signal that is processed to determine a phase difference and hence a distance, position, location, orientation, or relative movement, or combinations of the foregoing regarding the source. In another embodiment, an interrogator and a transponder in the form of an RF tag are provided, and the RF tag determines the phase difference of the signal or signals to determine a relationship between the tag and the interrogator. In a further embodiment, the interrogator determines a phase relationship of a multi-channel signal to determine the relationship, such as distance, position, location, or relative movement. Alternatively, the roles of the interrogator and RF tag are reversed. 
 The comparison and determination of a phase difference between the two signals are performed in one embodiment by phase locking the first signal to produce a reference signal. The reference signal is then mixed with the second signal to produce a mixed signal. A counter determines the phase difference by counting the number of nulls or peaks in the mixed signal, the nulls corresponding to respective portions of the signals that are of opposite phase to each other and the peaks corresponding to respective portions of the signals that are in phase with each other. The number of nulls or peaks within a period is directly related to the distance between the interrogator and the RF tag. In a preferred embodiment, the second signal is a frequency modulated signal that includes plural frequency portions each at different frequencies and the counter counts nulls or peaks in plural different mixed signals produced by mixing the respective frequency portions with the reference signal. 
 In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a multi-channel interrogator or receiver can be used where the phase information relative between multiple channels can be used with two or more successive readings in time or in frequency or in relative distance to determine a real distance, a position, and movement of a tag. Moreover, the system can be used to determine if a multi-path null has occurred to decide to use or not to use this information when determining distance by other means. In addition, other information can be used such as a null in either direction, field strength estimation, backscatter intensity, and ramping power to determine relative distance. In addition, two or more successive readings in time or frequency or relative distance can be made of the phase information relative to multiple channels to determine the relative field in front of a reader antenna by having a tag of known position modulate or having an antenna of known position modulate. Moreover, a combination of the above is also provided where a tag is powered in the standard UHF fashion at a single frequency at a time and where a lower power signal that is spread spectrum in nature or UWB is used to take a near-instantaneous snapshot of the data showing quadrature nulls. The plot so taken can contain much if not all of the data for determining distance or position or delta in relation to the standard ranging position using quadrature nulls.
","1. A method of determining distance between a signal source and a multi-channel signal receiver, the method comprising: 
obtaining successive readings on the multi-channel receiver of a signal from the signal source; 
measuring phase information of each signal on the channels of the multi-channel receiver to generate measured phase information; and 
determining a relationship between the receiver and the signal source by using the measured phase information, the relationship comprising actual distance between the signal source and the multi-channel receiver."
" The present invention, roughly described, pertains to technology for detecting whether a memory device has been over programmed. Once it is detected that one or more memory devices have been over programmed, the system can remedy the situation by any one of a number of known means for correcting data. For example, the system can re-write the data to the same or a different memory device. Such over programming detection assures that the data is free from errors due to over programming so that the requirements of the ECC can be reduced. 
 One embodiment of the present invention includes a method for detecting over programming in a memory system that uses multiple logical pages. The method includes programming a first multi-state storage element with data for a particular logical page and using data from a different logical page to determine whether the first multi-state storage element was over programmed. In one implementation, the system determines whether a threshold voltage of the first multi-state storage element is greater than a compare value. The system concludes that the first multi-state storage element is over programmed if the threshold voltage of the first multi-state storage element is greater than the compare value and the data for the different logical page indicates that the threshold voltage of the first multi-state storage element should not be greater than the compare value. The over programming detection is performed after both logical pages have been programmed. 
 Another embodiment of the present invention includes programming one or more multi-state storage elements associated with a first control line and subsequently programming one or more multi-state storage elements associated with the second control line. A determination is made as to whether one or more of the multi-state storage elements associated with the first control line are over programmed after programming the one or more multi-state storage elements associated with the second control line. The control lines can be word lines, bit lines, or another type of control line (depending upon the technology). In one embodiment, the over program determination is made by performing read operations on the multi-state storage elements associated with the first control line for edges of one or more over program ranges and determining that multi-state storage elements associated with a first control line are over programmed if they have a threshold voltage within one of the over program ranges. In another embodiment, the over program determination is made by performing read operations on the multi-state storage elements associated with the first control line for a set of one or more read compare points in order to determine initial states for the multi-state storage elements associated with the first control line; performing an error correction code process the multi-state storage elements associated with the first control line and the initial state; and determining that a multi-state storage element is over programmed if the error correction code process fails for that multi-state storage element. 
 In yet another embodiment, the present invention includes programming a first multi-state storage element and programming a second multi-state storage element. The system determines whether the first multi-storage element is over programmed after programming the second multi-storage element. 
 In one embodiment, the system implementing the present invention includes an array of storage elements and a managing circuit. The managing circuit can include dedicated hardware and/or can include hardware that is programmed by software stored on one or more storage devices such as non-volatile memory (e.g. flash memory, EEPROM, etc.) or other memory devices. In one embodiment, the managing circuit includes a controller and a state machine. In another embodiment, the managing circuit only includes a state machine and not a controller. The managing circuit can perform the steps discussed above. In some embodiments, the process for verifying whether a storage element is over programmed is performed by the state machine. In some implementations, the state machine is on the same integrated circuit chip as the array of storage elements. 
 These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will appear more clearly from the following description in which the preferred embodiment of the invention has been set forth in conjunction with the drawings.

" The present invention provides for a method for treating or preventing cardiac hypertrophy in a mammal, especially in a human, or a higher vertebrate such as birds. The method of the present invention may be used for the treatment of pathological hypertrophy, chronic heart failure, restrictive cardiomyopathies, valvuloseptal disorders, ischemic heart disease, emphysema, atherosclerosis, amyloidosis, viral myocarditis, cardiac dilatation, and genetic syndromes of dysfunctional heart action. 
 The method comprises reducing levels of retinol binding protein (RBP) or levels of retinoid in the mammal, or inhibiting the function of RBP or retinoid in the mammal, or inhibiting the function or activity of the retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway or pathways that are regulated by retinoid signaling or related regulatory pathway. 
 In one embodiment, a retinol structural antagonist, or a retinoid receptor antagonist, is administered to the mammal to block delivery of retinol by RBP, to the heart of the mammal, thereby reducing the progression or severity of pathological cardiac hypertrophy in the mammal. For example, the binding of RBP with transthyretin (TTR) is inhibited, or the expression of RBP or TTR or both is inhibited, such as via a suitable antisense nucleic acid molecule, or a suitable siRNA molecule. Alternatively, the function of RBP or TTR or both is inhibited via a suitable antibody, or a small molecule antagonist. 
 According to a preferred embodiment, an effective amount of an retinoid antagonist, such as N-[4-hydroxyphenyl]retinamide, is administered to the mammal. 
 In another embodiment, the expression or function of a retinoid receptor is inhibited for example, by a suitable antisense nucleic acid molecule, or a suitable siRNA molecule, a suitable antibody, or a small molecule antagonist. In a specific embodiment, the retinoid receptor is an RAR (e.g. RAR-α, RAR-β, or RAR-γ) or an RXR (e.g. RXR-α, RXR-β or RXR-γ). For example, the formation of an RXR/RXR, an RXR/RAR or an RAR/RAR dimer is inhibited. 
 The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of pathological hypertrophy, chronic heart failure, restrictive cardiomyopathies, valvuloseptal disorders, ischemic heart disease, emphysema, atherosclerosis, amyloidosis, viral myocarditis, cardiac dilatation, or genetic syndromes of dysfunctional heart action, the pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of a retinoid or a RAR receptor antagonist, and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.

" As effective as data warehousing systems are for predetermined queries, they are not particularly well suited for facilitating ad hoc analysis of large data sets. That is, because data warehousing systems are highly optimized to generate static reports, they do not efficiently support analysis of the data in which the questions are not known in advance. For example, a sales manager may look at a static report and see that nation-wide sales of a specific product during a particular month were lower than expected. However, because of the static nature of the report, the reason for the shortfall may not be apparent. In such a situation, the sales manager would like to be able to drill down into the data to determine, for example, whether there are any identifiable disparities (e.g., regional, temporal, etc.) which could serve as an explanation. These types of capabilities are the domain of OLAP. 
 OLAP systems organize data in multiple dimensions to allow the kind of ad hoc analysis which would allow the sales manager to zero in on the data which might explain the disparity identified in the static report. That is, using an OLAP solution, the sales manager could conduct a directed search which traverses various dimensions in the data before ultimately zeroing in on the detailed data of interest. This is to be contrasted with OLTP solutions which are highly optimized for retrieving detailed data and typically very poor at providing summaries. The OLAP approach is also to be contrasted with data warehousing solutions which would be required to maintain an impracticable number of summary tables to duplicate such functionality. 
 OLAP systems view data as residing at the intersection of dimensions. That is, the data underlying OLAP systems are organized and stored as a multi-dimensional database (or a modified relational database) which is an instantiation of the cross-product of all of the dimensions. This allows the user to traverse hierarchies of detail along dimensions of interest in an ad hoc manner to get at specific data. 
 On the other hand, a significant issue with OLAP solutions relates to the fact that they are typically only optimized for batch processing (as opposed to transaction processing which is characterized by near real-time updating). That is, the multi-dimensional “data cubes” which represent the summary data of interest grow geometrically as dimensions are added or expanded. This results in a database which includes vastly more summary data than detailed data. This, in turn, is a significant obstacle to supporting interactive updating of the data. That is, due to the large amount of highly interdependent summary information in the data underlying an OLAP system, the updating of any piece of detailed data tends to be computationally expensive in that many different summaries on many different levels of the hierarchy will typically need to be invalidated and recalculated. 
 Thus, instead of supporting the interactive updating of data, most OLAP systems typically employ overnight batch recalculations. There are OLAP solutions which attempt to strike various compromises to at least give the appearance of interactive updating. For example, some solutions repeatedly recalculate only the new input values in main memory (rather than the full database) giving the appearance of interactive updating. Other solutions employ scripting techniques to isolate and update subsets of data between batches. Unfortunately, these approaches only partially mitigate the inefficiencies associated with updating multi-dimensional data sets. 
 In view of the foregoing, it is desirable to provide techniques by which large, complex data sets may be more efficiently invalidated and recalculated to reflect changes. 
","1. A computer-implemented method for updating a database using a multi-dimensional data model in which data corresponding to the database are organized in multi-dimensional blocks, each block having summary information associated therewith corresponding to a current state of evolution of the associated block, the method comprising: 
maintaining dependency information in the data model which identifies data dependencies within and among the blocks; 
maintaining change information which identifies changes made to particular ones of the blocks and times at which the changes were made; and 
updating the database with reference to the dependency information, the summary information, and the change information, at least some of the blocks being updated without reference to all dependents thereof."
" The present invention is directed to a treatment device for treating a treatment site of an internal vessel of a mammal, such as a human being. The vessel, for example, can be an artery or other internal passageway within a patient. The vessel has a preplacement site inner diameter at a placement site prior to placement of the treatment device. The treatment device includes a frame that expands from a contracted, first configuration to an expanded, second configuration. 
 In one embodiment, the frame has a frame outer diameter at the second configuration that is approximately equal to the preplacement site inner diameter. In alternative non-exclusive embodiments, the frame outer diameter at the second configuration is greater than or equal to approximately 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, or 20 percent of the preplacement site inner diameter. 
 In one embodiment, the treatment device delivers a treatment to the treatment site. For example, the treatment device can include a coating that emits a treatment to the treatment site. In an alternative, non-exclusive embodiment, the treatment can include a drug or molecule that is emitted from the device into the bloodstream to be targeted to a treatment site downstream from the device. 
 In one embodiment, the frame includes a series of interconnected tubular shaped coils. In the expanded second configuration, the frarhe closely replicates the original lumen of the vessel at the placement site, and exerts only enough outward radial force to keep it in position at the placement site in the vessel. 
 The frame can be made of a resilient material and can be formed so that absent some restraint, each band expands from the first configuration to the second configuration. The amount that each band expands, absent restraint, can be controlled during the manufacture of the frame to suit the particular use of the treatment device. 
 In certain embodiments, the treatment device can be used to treat vulnerable or inflamed plaque with minimal trauma. For example, rather than increasing the arterial lumen like a stent, in certain embodiments, the treatment device will conform to the lumen and will exert only the minimal radial force required to prevent the treatment device from migrating down the artery. 
 The present invention is also directed to a method for treating a treatment site in a vessel.

" The present invention meets this need and provides an injection guide for facilitating botulinum toxin therapy by assisting the marking of a target skin area with a grid or pattern of staggered injection location marks or dots, at which locations (i.e. at the dots) a botulinum toxin can be injected. 
 The botulinum toxin (as either a complex [i.e. about 300 to about 900 kDa] or as a pure [i.e. about 150 kDa molecule]) used can be a botulinum toxin type A, B, C, D, E, F or G. 
 As used herein “about” means approximately or nearly and in the context of a numerical value or range set forth herein means±10% of the numerical value or range recited or claimed. 
 An injection guide for assisting botulinum toxin therapy according to our invention can comprise a material with an upper face and a lower face. The lower face of the material is suitable for placement in contact with an area of the dermis of a patient. The dermal area can be an area at which the patient experiences pain. The material can have a plurality of staggered perforations which extend completely through the material from the upper face to the lower face. By “staggered” it is meant that if a straight line A is drawn through all the perforations of any one row of perforations comprising the injection guide, then a line B drawn at a right angle to any one of the perforations upon the line A will not intersect any perforation present in a row of perforations immediately adjacent to (i.e. in the row above or in the row below the line A row) the perforations on the line A. 
 Additionally, the material can have an exterior border which circumscribes the material. The exterior border is not perforated because a user presses down on the border to hold the device in place when it is in use. 
 Preferably, the material is flexible, so that when the material is pressed again the dermal area, substantially all of the exterior border is in contact with the dermal area. The perforations in the material can be spaced apart in a staggered pattern. 
 A method for assisting a botulinum toxin therapy through use of our injection guide can have the steps of: determining a dermal area of a patient to which an administration of a botulinum toxin is required; placing in contact with the dermal area the lower face of the injection guide comprising; extending a marker through a perforation so as to mark a dermal surface under the lower face of the material, and; removing the device from contact with the dermal area.

" A game apparatus has a game element and a housing having a game element input and output. A combination setting system for changing the combination of the game includes a plurality of concentric code wheels in which each code wheel has a plurality of openings therein sized for a game element to pass therethrough and a plurality of concentric indicia wheels. Each of the concentric indicia wheels may be removable attached to one code wheel in a plurality of positions aligning a plurality of code wheel openings between adjacent concentric wheels to form a plurality of selectable combination paths through said plurality of code wheels. The attached concentric code and indicia wheels are separately rotatably mounted in the housing. A plurality of the code wheel openings each has a diverter member therein for diverting a game element passing therethrough from the path between code wheel openings when a diverter member is positioned in any one of the concentric code wheel openings of a selected combination path. The attaching of each concentric code wheel with each concentric indicia wheel forms a combination pathway for the game element to pass through so that rotation of each of the attached indicia and code wheels is used to align the openings in the code wheels for guessing the code having the correct path for the game element to pass through. Each indicia wheel has a series of numerals thereon rotatable to different positions. Each indicia wheel has a plurality of openings therein and has an indicia element, such as a ball, removably positioned in the openings so that the indicia element is outputted from each of the selected openings upon attaching a code wheel to an indicia wheel. The housing has a latching hinged door which unlatches when the game element passes through the correct combination pathway. The door latch is attached to the housing and unlatches the hinge door when the game element falls on one end of a latching lever upon passing through the correct combination pathway. The one diverter member in the innermost concentric code wheel opening is mounted in a separate direction to the other diverter members in the concentric code wheel openings for directing the game element against the latching lever to actuate the door latch. Thus, each diverter member facing in one of two directions and each code wheel opening may or may not have a diverter member. A plurality of concentric code wheels and attached indicia wheels rotate around a center tube mounted to the housing and having the door latch mounted therein. The concentric code wheels and each concentric indicia wheel are each attached together by a plurality of pegs on one wheel pushing into openings in the other wheel while simultaneously driving a plurality of indicia elements from each indicia wheel. 
 The game is played by presetting each code wheel in one of its plurality of positions relative to its associated indicia wheel and connecting the wheels to form a plurality of pathways through each set of code wheels which simultaneously pushes out indicia elements from the indicia wheels. The attached code wheel and indicia wheels are then rotated to any of the indicated numerals on the indicia wheels to set up a combination which align three of the code wheel openings with an opening in the housing so that a game element or token can be dropped therein to follow through the pathway created by the code wheel openings. If the correct combination is selected, the game element falls upon the latching mechanism to unlatch the door.

" The invention is implemented within an operating system that continually or periodically monitors memory usage. Three usage thresholds are established, and different actions are taken as increasingly critical memory usage thresholds are reached. At each threshold, the objective is to free memory so that the next higher threshold is avoided. 
 At the first, least critical threshold, one or more application programs are simply requested to minimize their memory usage. The request is issued to the least recently active programs, through their Windows® message loops. The applications can respond to the requests as they deem appropriate. Well-behaved applications will take steps to release resources as much as possible. 
 At the second, more critical threshold, the operating system closes one or more of the application programs. The application is closed using a standard operating system mechanism that allows the application to shut down in an orderly fashion, while saving files and performing any other necessary housekeeping. 
 At the third, most critical threshold, the operating system simply terminates one or more of the application programs. The application program's thread(s) are destroyed and all resources previously used by the application program are released. The application program is given no opportunity to clean up, to save files, or to perform any other housekeeping chores. 
 Other measures are potentially employed before taking any of the three measures described above. For example, an attempt is made to reclaim any unused stack space. In addition, read-only memory pages are discarded. Such preventative measures are preferably initiated at further memory usage thresholds. These further thresholds preferably have a fixed relationship to the first, second, and third thresholds noted above.

" It is believed that a large percentage of women are accommodated with ill-fitted brassieres due to the lack of a reliable industry standard for correlating brassiere size with women's anatomy. It has been discovered in accordance with the present invention that an anthropometric standard does indeed exist to correlate brassiere size with the average women's anatomy which will enable a single brassiere design to satisfy all normal to slightly overweight women (limited to women who are not obese) having average to above average sized breasts. 
 The brassiere of the present invention is designed to support and exert force on the wearer's breasts to move them to a more superior and medial direction on the chest wall in accordance with an anthropometric standard. This anthropometric standard is achieved in accordance with the present invention by designing the brassiere to satisfy a narrow breast base width measurement for each breast cup when the brassiere is extended; i.e., when worn. The base width standard may be accomplished by controlling the elasticity of the panel sections of the brassiere relative to one another such that the base width of each breast cup stays within a narrow measurement of preferably between 10.5 and 14.5 cm, and more preferably between 11.5 to 13.5 centimeters. Previously the base width of a brassiere breast cup when extended around the chest, significantly exceeded this measurment. A brassiere which meets this standard will accommodate normal to slightly overweight women with average to somewhat above average breasts without the need for excess padding. Heretofore a brassiere was never designed to satisfy a limited base width measurement for each breast cup. 
 From an overall perspective the brassiere of the present invention broadly comprises two brassiere cups each having three separate panel sections representing a lateral panel section, a medial panel section and a superior panel section respectively with the three panel sections of each breast cup arranged such that the superior panel section extends superiorly to cover the nipple area of the breast and with the elasticity of the panel sections of the brassiere relative to one another controlled such that the superior panel section possesses a substantially greater elasticity than is possessed by the other two panel sections and with the base width measurement of each breast cup limited to a narrow measurement of preferably between 10.5 and 14.5 cm, and more preferably between 11.5 to 13.5 centimeters.

" In the two production processes described above, a statement about the quality of the arrays produced can only be provided after they have been completed. For this purpose, for example chips taken at least randomly from a batch are hybridised with a standard sample and the chip quality is determined by means of the hybridisation signals. A disadvantage of this approach is that no reliable statements regarding the quality of each individual chip can be made where hybridisation is carried out on random samples. If sample hybridisation were carried out with each individual chip, their signals would have to be extinguished again after evaluation using a suitable method. 
 An alternative approach regarding the quality control of arrays produced by synthesis has been described by M. Beier and J. D. Hoheisel, Nucleic Acids Res. 2000, Vol. 28, No.4. According to this publication, a dye is coupled to the array surface via a labile linker following the synthesis of the oligonucleotides. The signal intensity determined on the individual spots is a measure of the synthesis yield. This method has the disadvantage that the labelling needs to be removed before the hybridisation assay and cannot be used simultaneously for the detection of hybridisation results.

" The objective is achieved by a method wherein the strip or sheet bar material used in the form of light metals and their alloys, more particularly aluminum or magnesium, and which is characterized in that the end thickness of the strip or sheet bar material comprises at least three different thickness stages. Between the individual thickness stages of constant thickness, there are provided regions of transition with variable thicknesses, more particularly with a gradient ranging between 1:40 and 1:4000 defined by thickness difference units over length units. The inventive products can be used, for example, for further improving the weight and strength optimization in motor vehicle construction. For instance, while the greatest thickness stage can be used for producing connections, several further thickness stages make it possible to achieve specific adaptations to different load application curves, which includes loads in the elastic deformation range and loads in crash cases involving plastic deformation. 
 It is important that, when carrying out this method, the thickness of the material be reduced by at least 5% along its entire length with reference to the starting thickness which is assumed to be 100%. In this way, there is achieved an intermediate product with an improved quality and an increased dimensional accuracy. 
 The differences in the end thickness of the material between thickness stages adjoining one another in respect of thickness should amount to at least 10%, preferably in excess of 20%, in order to produce specifically usable strength differences of the preliminary product for formed sheet metal parts to be produced therefrom. 
 Preferred thickness ranges for the at least three thickness ranges are mentioned below. The selection of concrete values primarily depends on the strength requirements for the end product to be produced from the inventive material. 
 The change in the different thickness stages can take place in any sequence on the sheet bar or strip material, with the sequence being periodically repeated in the strip material. 
 The maximum reduction in thickness of 70%, with reference to the starting thickness of 100%, should not be exceeded. In addition, a maximum gradient of the transition regions between the individual adjoining thickness stages of approximately 1:40 has to be observed. The proposed minimum gradient is 1:4000. In practice, values near the maximum gradient will prevail. 
 If the strip or sheet bar material is used in the form of aluminum, the material can be cold-rolled or, for hot-rolling purposes, it can be heated to a temperature ranging between 350° and 470° C. 
 If the strip or sheet bar material is used in the form of magnesium, the material can be cold-rolled or, for hot-rolling purposes, it can be heated to a temperature ranging between 180° to 280° C. 
 In the case of hot-rolling, the strip material can be preheated at the wound-up coil. However, it is also possible to heat uncoiled strip in a continuous process, more particularly in the case of induction heating. 
 Furthermore, the invention includes metal strip or metal sheet bar produced in accordance with this process as well as planar elements, tubes or profiles produced therefrom. 
 The flexibly rolled material can be cut to lengths or trimmed and processed further in different ways and is suitable for different uses. First, reference is made to German Publication DE 100 41 281 A1 according to which sheet bar of flexibly rolled metal strip can be formed by deep-drawing or other forming processes into profiles or dish-shaped elements. Furthermore, reference is made to the earlier German Publication DE 103 23 694 A1 according to which directly after the flexible rolling of continuous strip material the latter is formed into a continuous tube or profile and cut into individual tube or profile pieces. Furthermore, reference is made to German Publication DE 103 23 693 A1 according to which flexibly rolled material is formed into tube or profile members with out-of-round cross-sections. In addition, reference is made to German patent application 102004017343.5 dated Apr. 6, 2004 according to which, by deep drawing, flexibly rolled material is formed into a tube or profile whose cross-section is variable in the longitudinal direction.

","1. A method of flexibly rolling a metal strip or a metal sheet bar wherein the metal strip or metal sheet bar is rolled in the longitudinal direction of the rolling operation along its entire length from a starting thickness to an end thickness which is variable along its length, and wherein the strip or sheet bar material used is in the form of light metals, wherein said end thickness comprises at least three different thickness stages."
" The invention recognizes that the consequences of intentional flooding attacks and nonintentional overload situations resulting from a burst of connection requests can be mitigated by dropping the traditional notion of attempting to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate traffic. An increase in packet discards by a protocol stack is a good indicator of an attack. An attacker's intent is to use up system resources. This can be done by filling up queues, consuming storage or just burning CPU cycles. Most TCP stacks limit queue size and detect and discard overflow and malformed packets. The number of packet discards and the rate of discards are normally relatively low. The invention monitors the number and rate of packet discards and raises an event when a specified percentage of traffic received on a physical interface is being discarded. Protocol stacks already contain a number of packet checks, such as malformed packets, checksum failures, no application to receive a packet, queue level full, etc. Packets are discarded by each of these checks. In the preferred embodiment, a discard rate check is performed not on every discard, but after a specified number of discarded packets is received. This limits the amount of processing that is devoted in the main packet processing line to attack detection. 
 The preferred embodiment is also able in many cases to trace the source of a flood back at least to a prior hop. 
 The preferred embodiment requires that a minimum number of packet discards occur within a specified interval to trigger further detection. For example, a policy might specify an interval and require that 1000 packet discards occur within that interval before a further flood check is performed. This prevents situations of triggering a flood condition when a high rate of discards occurs in a small number of packets. If this minimum number of discards in an interval is met, then the rate of discards for that or a different interval is determined. If the rate exceeds a specified threshold, then a flood event is initiated. During a flood event, flood monitoring occurs. Flood monitoring attempts to detect, again using minimum discards and rate thresholds, when a flood has ended. During monitoring, flood data is collected at intervals and stored for future analysis. Such data includes Discard counts, discard rates, protocol types, discard types and prior hop Media Access Control (MAC) addresses associated with discarded packets.
","1. A method of detecting a denial of service attack at a network server, comprising the steps of 
counting the number of inbound packets and the number of discarded packets X in a specified interval, 
if the number of discarded packets X in the interval exceeds a specified minimum X(MIN), then calculating the percentage of discarded packets R=X divided by the number of inbound packets, and 
if R exceeds a specified threshold, then setting a denial of service event marker."

 According to one aspect of the present invention, in a method of receiving a plurality of signals at a plurality of receive antennas in different paths from a plurality of transmit antennas in a mobile communication system, transmitted signals from at least two predetermined paths are estimated using signals received at each of the receive antennas using a predetermined rule. One of the estimated signals is selected according to a predetermined method and the other estimated signal is stored.

" The object of the present invention is to improve the roll-down tube for a pneumatic spring in such a way that the roll-down tube can have even more complicated internal contours. 
 According to the invention, the roll-down tube is formed by two individual shell-like elements of injection molded plastic. 
 The great advantage of the invention is that a more functional internal contour can be produced, regardless of the way in which the roll-down tube itself is manufactured. In the case of a roll-down tube made out of injection-molded plastic, therefore, more favorable material distributions can be provided and more favorable stiffening ribs obtained. 
 It is simpler, in general, for the parting line to be parallel to the longitudinal axis of the roll-down tube. For the purpose of improving the seal between the individual shell-like elements, however, at least one parting line between the individual elements should extend at an angle to the longitudinal axis. When an axial load acts on the individual elements, the elements will thus be clamped together in the area of the parting line. 
 In another advantageous embodiment, sealing means are provided between the individual elements. When the sealing means are sprayed onto the individual element, the contour of the parting line(s) can be designed with greater freedom, because there is no need to depend on prefabricated sealing strips or sealing rings. The extra labor required to install a separate sealing ring is also eliminated. 
 It is also provided that one of the individual elements has at least one axial support surface for at least one other individual element. The axial support surface prevents the two individual elements from being pushed beyond their final assembly position with respect to each other. 
 In addition, at least one locking means on at least one of the individual elements secures the individual elements with respect to each other in their final assembly position. The roll-down tube thus forms a closed structural unit. 
 An effective way to prevent the locking means from being opened is to design the locking means in the form of at least one snap hook, which acts on the minimum of one other individual element. 
 In addition, an individual element has at least one radial retaining element for the minimum of one other individual element. Thus, after assembly has been completed, the roll-down tube cannot come apart under the action of radial loads. 
 It is also possible for the individual elements of the roll-down tube to be secured by a retaining ring. The retaining ring can be formed, for example, by a collar band for the rolling bellows of the pneumatic spring. 
 As an alternative, at least one of the individual elements can have fastening means which enter into a working connection with the retaining ring. 
 The working connection between the retaining ring and the minimum of one individual element can be formed by pins, for example, which fit into holes. It is advisable for at least two individual elements to have these pins and to be held in place with respect to each other in the radial direction by the retaining ring. 
 So that the working connection cannot come apart by itself during the operation of the pneumatic spring, the pins are provided with latching elements. The latching elements are designed to act like barbs. 
 The retaining ring can also be used to exert a clamping force on the rolling bellows of the pneumatic spring. 
 So that the clamping force which the retaining ring must exert can be kept small, the roll-down tube has a circumferential edge, over which the rolling bellows is inverted, and the retaining ring clamps the rolling bellows against the roll-down tube. The pressure inside the rolling bellows and the frictional force between the rolling bellows and the roll-down tube reinforce the clamping effect. 
 In addition, independently of the sealing and locking means, it is also possible for the individual elements to be welded to each other or bonded to each other with an adhesive. 
 Other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. It is to be understood, however, that the drawings are designed solely for purposes of illustration and not as a definition of the limits of the invention, for which reference should be made to the appended claims.

" In accordance with the present inventions, an expandable intravascular medical device is provided. The medical device comprises an expandable tubular body. In the preferred embodiment, the tubular body is cylindrical, so that it can more easily conform to a blood vessel, although, in its broadest aspects, other geometries are contemplated by the invention. The tubular body includes an integrated resilient support structure that forms a plurality of electrically conductive regions to which the lead(s) is coupled. The tubular body further includes at least one electrically insulative element disposed between the conductive regions. The medical device further comprises at least one lead electrically coupled to the conductive regions. The conductive regions may be completely electrically isolated from each other, so that, e.g., as electrodes, they can be operated in parallel.

" The present invention provides novel high temperature and wear resistant ceramic matrix composite (CMC) gun barrel liners for gun barrels having a lightweight outer shell consisting of a metal matrix composite (MMC) or a high strength metal such as titanium. In the case of the CMC inner layer, the unique use of a mandrel with inverse rifling allows for the in-situ generation of rifling in the CMC layer. More particularly, the present invention in one aspect provides a CMC lined gun barrel with no distinct interface between the so-called liner and outer wrap.

The other method involves forming the refractory alloy by plasma transferred arc solid free form fabrication (PTA SFFF). In PTA SFFF, metal powder(s) or a mixture of a metal powder or powders plus a ceramic powder or powders, is fed through a plasma transfer arc welding torch and deposited on the inner surface of a tubular metallic substrate. The position of the torch head is controlled by a multi-axis motion controller, such as a multi-axis CNC controller or a multi-axis robotic controller. The motion of the torch head is controlled so as to deposit 3-dimensional structures of the metal or metal-ceramic mixture on the inner surface of the tubular substrate. Alternatively, a wire feed can be used in place of the powder feed to deposit the desired material. In either case, there is no abrupt interface between the liner and the overwrap, which since it is deposited in the liquid state, will react with the liner to chemically bond the two components. Thus, one innovation of the present invention is the 2 fabrication of a graded gun barrel, which gradually changes from a highly wear resistant bore to a high strength overwrap.

" The object of the invention is to provide a method for the torque-oriented control of an internal combustion engine with an exhaust turbocharger. 
 For an internal combustion engine with an exhaust turbocharger, the invention provides that the set torque is limited by an air mass-dependent maximum torque. The air mass-dependent maximum torque is computed from a fuel quantity and an actual efficiency factor. During the transition from one-supercharger operation to two-supercharger operation, the air mass-dependent maximum torque is computed from a supercharger switch torque. After the expiration of a time interval, the air mass-dependent maximum torque is recomputed according to the current operating state of the engine. 
 The invention offers the advantages that during nonsteady-state operation, e.g., during supercharger switching, the exhaust gas values are improved, and the output torque corresponds to the limited desired torque. This means that the control is always optimally adjusted to the output torque of the engine. 
 Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the invention that refers to the accompanying drawings.

" According to the invention, a method and apparatus for adaptively adjusting the bandwidth of a data transmission channel having multiple buffered paths is disclosed.

A value representative of at least the number of said buffers that are nearly empty of data as compared to a threshold is determined, and the transmission rate of the input path is adjusted according to said value.

" Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a force-feedback input device that does not produce an unnatural click sensation from button to button and, therefore, does not provide an operator with an unpleasant sensation even when a plurality of buttons is displayed on the display means. 
 According to the present invention, a force-feedback input device includes display means, input means, and control means. The display means displays a cursor and a plurality of buttons. The input means includes an operating portion, a detecting portion for detecting an amount of movement of the operating portion, and an actuator for providing a required external force to the operating portion. The control means controls the display of the cursor based on an operational amount signal from the detecting portion and driving of the actuator so as to provide an attractive force to the operating portion based on the relationship between positions of the cursor and the buttons. The control means controls driving of the actuator based on the relationship between positions of the cursor and a borderline between a first attractive area and a second attractive area appearing in the vicinities of adjacent first and second buttons. 
 Since driving of the actuator is controlled based on the relationship between positions of the cursor and the borderline between the attractive areas, no unnatural click sensation occurs when the cursor passes across the borderline between the attractive areas by preventing an abrupt change in the strength of the attractive force on the borderline. 
 Preferably, in the force-feedback input device, the control means controls driving of the actuator such that the attractive force decreases as the distance between the cursor and the borderline decreases. 
 Since the actuator is controlled so that the attractive force decreases as the distance between the cursor and the borderline is decreased, an abrupt change in the strength of the attractive force on the borderline is prevented. Therefore, no unnatural click sensation occurs when the cursor passes across a borderline between the attractive areas. 
 According to the present invention, when a plurality of buttons is displayed on display means, a force-feedback input device controls driving of an actuator based on the relationship between a cursor and a borderline of attractive areas. Consequently, abrupt change in the strength of the attractive force on the borderline is prevented and, therefore, no unnatural click sensation occurs when the cursor passes across a borderline between the attractive areas.

" It is the object of the invention to provide a film scanner by means of which the geometric accuracy of scanning is improved. 
 For this purpose, the photosensitive photodetector is arranged in a housing to which the film carrier is connected. In this way, there is a fixed mechanical orientation between the film carrier, light passage and photodetector. 
 The film carrier is connected to the housing by a reproducible, detachable connection or by a fixed, rigid connection. Further, an objective by means of which the at least one light passage is optically imaged onto the at least one photosensitive photodetector is arranged in the housing. 
 The objective is rigidly connected to the housing and/or the film carrier. In this way, all of the components necessary for exact geometric alignment are brought together in structural form so that time-consuming alignment can be dispensed with and uniform imaging quality is ensured. The broadband irradiation source is preferably arranged outside the housing. 
 In a preferred embodiment form, the photosensitive photodetector is constructed as an RGB line sensor. Three lines with an R filter, G filter and B filter, respectively, are arranged in a sensor housing. The distance between the three lines is small enough that the three lines detect approximately the same scene. In this way, three recordings are carried out synchronously for the R line, G line and B line. Therefore, fluctuations in synchronous running can be tolerated to a degree because at least the individual R recordings, G recordings and B recordings are synchronous. The RGB line sensor can be constructed as a CCD line sensor or CMOS line sensor. 
 In another preferred embodiment form, broadband filters for red, green and blue that are adapted to the sensitivity of the human eye are associated with the photosensitive photodetectors and lines of the RGB line sensor. 
 In another preferred embodiment form, a plug-in gray filter is arranged in the housing between the film carrier and the photosensitive photodetector. By means of the plug-in gray filter, it is possible to simulate the transmission of the film during the balancing of the broadband irradiation source so that the full radiometric resolution of the photodetector can be made use of. After balancing, the gray filter is removed. The broadband irradiation source is preferably constructed as a white light source. 
 In another preferred embodiment form, an NIR blocking filter is arranged between the broadband irradiation source and the film carrier. This NIR blocking filter prevents near-infrared irradiation of the photodetector. 
 In another preferred embodiment form, the film scanner comprises an NIR illumination source which illuminates another light passage, the light passage being optically imaged on an NIR sensor. The NIR sensor serves to detect scratches and/or perforations. 
 The NIR sensor is constructed, for example, as an RGB line sensor. This is possible because the commercially available filters for RGB line sensors are transparent in the NIR range. 
 In another preferred embodiment form, the timing of the photosensitive photodetectors is synchronized with the film transport. It is further advantageous that shrinkage of the film material is detected based on a detection of perforations and the synchronization is readjusted in an adaptive manner. When the diameter of the film material (capstan roller) and the absolute synchronization by the perforations are known, the line sensor can determine film shrinkage. This determination is based on the fact that the capstan on a film that is known to be shrunk synchronizes a quantity of scanning lines, which quantity is likewise assumed to be known, with respect to its diameter. The determination of shrinkage is based on the difference between the actual quantity of lines and the quantity of expected lines. Based on this shrinkage measurement, an estimation algorithm is learned which is capable of regulating the synchronization in an adaptive manner. The perforation detection is preferably carried out by means of a combined mechanical and optical measurement of the perforation holes, where the mechanical measurement is carried out by means of an incremental sensor at the capstan roller and the optical measurement is carried out by means of the NIR line sensor.

" A primary goal of the present invention is to provide a reliable method and apparatus for accurately measuring the draft of a vessel. 
 Another goal of the present invention is to provide a device for measuring the draft of a vessel, wherein an individual can carefully, safely and conveniently determine the draft on a semi-continuous basis while the device is still placed in the fluid in which the vessel is floating. 
 A further goal of the present invention is to provide a device for measuring the draft of a vessel, wherein the pressure created by the level of water is used to determine the draft when the device is immersed in the water in which the vessel is floating. 
 A still further goal of the present invention is to decrease the difficulty of taking draft measurements and increase the accuracy of draft measurements as compared to prior art devices by compensating for fluctuations in an observable level of water used to determine the draft, the fluctuations arising from wave action, fluid surges due to hydrostatic pressure and underwater currents. 
 Yet another goal of the present invention is to reduce alignment errors between a device for measuring the draft of a vessel and the actual draft of the vessel. 
 According to one aspect the present invention is a device for measuring the draft of a vessel floating in a body of water. The device includes a tube having an upper end, a lower end, and a known length between the upper and lower ends. The device includes an electronic pressure sensor to measure the pressure at the lower end of the tube. Thus an operator can stand safely away from the edge of the vessel and observe the pressure created by placing the tube into the fluid to the point that is consistent with a reference point on the vessel. 
 Another aspect of the present invention is electronic draft measurement device for measuring the draft of a vessel including a tube of a known length having a lower end being immersed in water, and a pressure sensor measuring the pressure head of the water at the lower end of the tube.

" The present invention satisfies this need, and presents a system, a service, a computer program product, and an associated method (collectively referred to herein as “the system” or “the present system”) for datatype caching, resolving, and escalating an SQL expression with references. The present system accelerates the processing of the SQL expression to fetch the datatype of the SQL expression. Concurrently, the present system validates the SQL expression that the user provides for the object for which the datatype is requested. 
 The datatypes of the direct children of an SQL statement are required to resolve the datatype of the SQL statement. Consequently, the present system places in cache the datatype of each object to leverage its use when referenced by another object. An advantage of the present system is that datatype resolution may be performed in constant time (much faster than the conventional solution) since the SQL expression remains the same except for the substitution of datatypes for tokens. As used herein, constant time means that regardless of how deep the nesting of the SQL templates or objects is, the time required to process the SQL template is the same because only the datatype one level down is fetched, as opposed to fetching many levels down depending on the depth of the tree. 
 In addition, the algorithm of the present system for generating the valid SQL statement used to resolve the datatype is relatively simple, using a simple “search and replace” of tokens with the function “CAST(NULL as DATATYPE)”. Furthermore, the resulting valid SQL statement is much smaller than that provided by conventional systems. Consequently, the depth of the reference tree analyzed for datatype may be much larger. 
","1. A method for datatype caching of an SQL template with references, comprising: 
converting the SQL template into a converted SQL template with an associated cast function; 
acquiring a datatype of the converted SQL template; and 
storing the datatype of the converted SQL template with the SQL template."

" The present invention provides methods, apparatus, products, techniques and systems for controlling the traffic flow across a gateway using multiple gateway devices that are acting as a virtual router. Gateway devices in a redundancy group share responsibility for outgoing packets from hosts through the distribution of forwarding addresses, such as virtual MAC addresses, to gateway devices to which hosts are directed in response to ARP requests. 
 One aspect of the present invention is a method of controlling traffic flow in a load-sharing redundancy group that includes a first gateway device and a second gateway device, where the gateway devices are configured to forward packets sent from hosts. One group of forwarding addresses is assigned to the first gateway device and a second group of forwarding addresses are assigned to the second gateway device. The redundancy group distributes forwarding addresses to hosts which in turn use the distributed forwarding addresses to send packets to the redundancy group. The traffic flow for each of the assigned forwarding addresses is measured and may, in some cases, be compared to a target traffic flow, which can be a desired traffic balancing among the redundancy group members. Comparison of the measured traffic flow to the target traffic flow may not be necessary in connection with some target traffic flows. 
 The traffic flow is then adjusted to close in on the target traffic flow. Adjustment of the traffic flow may be accomplished by changing the existing measured traffic flow (for example, by re-assigning a forwarding address having a certain measured traffic on a gateway device to a different gateway device) or by altering the future distribution of forwarding addresses so that additional traffic is sent to the forwarding addresses having lower measured traffic. The gateway devices can be routers using virtual MAC addresses as forwarding addresses. The redundancy group may also be configured to provide failover services in the event that one of the gateway devices ceases operation. A computer program product having a machine readable medium and program instructions contained in the machine readable medium, may specify one or more of these methods of controlling traffic flow in a load-sharing redundancy group.

The primary gateway device has one or more processors and a memory in communication with at least one of the processors. A least one of the processors and the memory are configured to assign a first group of forwarding addresses to the primary gateway device and to assign a second plurality of forwarding addresses to the secondary gateway device. The primary gateway device distributes forwarding addresses to hosts which use the distributed forwarding addresses to send outgoing packets to the virtual gateway. The traffic flow for each assigned forwarding address in each gateway device is measured and may be compared to a target traffic flow in some cases. The traffic flow is then adjusted. 
 Adjustment of the traffic flow may be accomplished by the primary gateway device by changing the existing measured traffic flow (for example, by re-assigning a forwarding address having a certain measured traffic on a gateway device to a different gateway device) or by altering the future distribution of forwarding addresses so that additional traffic is sent to the forwarding addresses having lower measured traffic. The primary and secondary gateway devices can be routers using virtual MAC addresses as forwarding addresses.

 In order to attain the object, a fixing device according to the present invention includes a fix member for touching an unfixed image on a recording medium and a press member for being pressed against the fixing member, so as to fix the unfixed image on the recording medium by transporting the recording medium through a nip between the fix member and the press member, wherein:

 where K1 is a heat transmission coefficient of the press member and K2 is a heat transmission coefficient of the fix member. 

 The “heat transmission coefficient” of a material is a parameter that indicates how easily heat flux passes through the material. The larger this parameter, the more easily the heat flux passes through the material. Specifically, the heat transmission coefficient of a material is a reciprocal number of heat transmission resistance of the material. Moreover, the heat transmission resistance of a material can be calculated by (thickness of the material/heat conductivity of the material). 
 As a result of diligent studies, the inventors of the present invention found out that it is easy to transmit heat to the fix member but it is difficult to transmit, to the press member, the heat thus transmitted to the fix member, thereby efficiently utilizing, for fixing operation, the heat transmitted to the fix member, where in the fixing device the heat transmission coefficient K1 of the press member and the heat transmission coefficient K2 of the fix member satisfy (100·K1)≦(K2)≦(320·K1).

" The invention includes a current mirror that provides high output impedance and high output voltage swing in a compact, simple design. The current mirror can be implemented using a single current source, thereby minimizing the power consumption of the current mirror. 
 According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a current mirror includes a current source, a saturated transistor of a first conductivity type, and a diode-connected transistor of a second conductivity type, all serially connected between first and second supply voltages. 
 The current mirror also includes an output transistor of the second conductivity type and a mirroring transistor of the second conductivity type that are serially connected between an output terminal and the second supply voltage. This cascoded pair of transistors ensures that the current mirror has a high output impedance. 
 The diode-connected transistor sinks (or sources) a reference current from the current source, and in the process generates a gate voltage that is supplied to the mirroring transistor. This gate voltage causes the mirroring transistor to sink (or source) an output current equal to the reference current. 
 Meanwhile, the gate of the output transistor is connected to the source of the saturated transistor, and therefore receives a gate voltage that is one saturation voltage higher than the gate voltage provided to the mirroring transistor. The output transistor is therefore able to sink (or source) the output current (reference current) generated by the mirroring transistor. 
 In addition, this gate voltage provided to the gate of the output transistor allows the current mirror to have a relatively wide output voltage range. Specifically, the drain of the output transistor can swing from the first supply voltage all the way to twice its saturation voltage from the second supply voltage (assuming that all transistors are matched) before the output transistor falls out of saturation.

" The invention solves the problem by using a modified modulator for the DSPK format with a differential coder that has a delay in the feed back loop longer than one bit period T. 
 One example is a 2T instead of T (T being the bit-time). In this case the time delay between the output and input of the EXOR function needs only be below 50 ps at 40 Gb/s, and the external “feedback line” can be fabricated with a delay of 50 ps. As a consequence, the fabrication tolerance of the differential coder is relaxed.
 The invention is explained in the figures and the description of the figures as follows: 
 FIG. 1 One embodiment of a DPSK transmission system 
 FIG. 2 common and invention differential coder 
 FIG. 3 common and invention Mach Zehnder Filter 
 FIG. 4 Interference result of a Mach Zehnder filter 
 FIG. 5 Eye diagram of DSPK (left) and comparison of optical filters with T and 2T delay line 
 Short Description of the Invention 
 A block diagram of a possible DPSK transmission system is shown in FIG. 1. On the transmitter side, reference numeral 201 denotes a transmission light source formed of a semiconductor laser oscillating at fixed amplitude and frequency and 202 denotes a phase modulator for modulating the phase of light from the transmission light source 201. In order that the demodulation by means of a one-bit delayed signal is performed on the receiver side, input data is previously modified on the transmitter side into a differential code by a differential coder 203 and the code is supplied to the phase modulator 202 through an amplifier 204. 
 The light transmitted to the receiver side through an optical fiber 205 is fed to a Mach Zehnder Filter 214 at the receiver side. The transmitted data are filtered in the Mach Zehnder filter 214 before they are converted from the optical to the electrical signals. The detector 215 is for example a dual balanced detector as described in the prior art. The feed back loop the detector 215 is connected to the Mach Zehnder filter via a control mean 216 that apply a signal for stabilization of the unbalanced Mach Zehnder filter. A dithering technique is useful for the electronic stabilization of the filter function. is 
 For higher bit rate system an optical filtering is advantageous. Mandatory for the use of the DSPK in a WDM system is the optical filtering for channel selection. 
 In a common DPSK system a differential coder 203 changes the input electrical data into a different data stream. With conventional DPSK, this differential coder 203 needs a delay line 212 of exactly one bit-time T between the output of the EXOR function and its input. This means the EXOR is performed between the current bit of the original signal and the previous bit of the new signal. The resulting signal is applied to an electro optic phase modulator 202, which transforms it into a phase-coded optical signal. For example, the “0” bits are coded with a phase of π, the “1” s with a phase of 0. The signal is transmitted over a fibre link consisting of optical fibre spans and amplifiers. 
 At the receiving end, the optical phase-coded signal is transformed into an amplitude-coded signal by a Mach-Zehnder (MZ) filter 214. The principle of the filter is the following: one of its arms is delayed by one bit-time delay in the delay line 213 with respect to the other arm; therefore, at the output of the filter, the interference of the signal with itself, delayed by one bit-time, is detected. If the two bits have the same phase, constructive interference gives maximum power (“1”). If the two bits have opposite phases, destructive interference gives minimum power (“0”) 
 According to the invention, a DPSK format with 2-bit delay is proposed. The differential coder 203 then needs a loop of 2T 212, and is easier to fabricate. However, the MZ filter also needs a 2 bit delay 213 in one arm see FIG. 3, and, as a consequence, the filter positioning tolerance is decreased as it is shown in the performance measurement of FIG. 5. The tolerance is only half that of classical DPSK. At 10 Gb/s, the differential coder is easy to fabricate, and filter positioning is an issue. Therefore, this new solution is interesting for bit rates of 40 Gb/s and above, where the differential coder is difficult to fabricate, and the optical filter tolerance is larger in terms of absolute frequency shift. This solution also yields an open eye at the receiver end.

Optical transmission system with transmitter, transmission line and receiver, comprising a filter adopted to the modulation scheme, where the transmitted signal is modulated by a diffential phase shift keying modulation scheme using a differential coder (203) and a phase modulator (202) characterized in that the diffential coder (203) comprises an EXOR circuit, with a time delay of at least 2 bits in the attached feed back loop."

" For a case where the aforementioned air-supply fan is used, it is necessary to fabricate the fan equipped to the housing in a size fitting to the fuel cell. In other words, a small fuel cell needs fabrication and attachment of a small fan. Downsizing of the fan, however, increases an occupational ratio of the motor provided at the center portion of the housing, and this undesirably reduces a blast sectional area, and may consequently lower blasting capacity more than as being expected from the decrease in the vertical and lateral dimensions of the fan. 
 In order to ensure an effective power generation of the fuel cell, it is also necessary to ensure uniformity in the air flow rate in the individual flow paths of the fuel cell. For a case where the fan is attached to every fuel cell as described in Patent Document 1, it is necessary to fabricate an optimum fan capable of ensuring uniformity in the air flow rate in the individual flow paths in the fuel cell, each time the size or geometry of the fuel cell is modified.

 Because flow rates of the fluid discharged from the individual openings of the fluid conveyance unit are equal in the power generation unit of the present invention, also flow rates of the fluid flowing through the individual flow paths of the power generation cell become equal. Mounting of-the fluid conveyance unit on the power generation unit is, therefore, successful in equalizing the flow rates of the fluid in the individual flow paths, and this ensures an effective power generation. The fluid conveyance unit is capable of discharging the fluid excellent in the flow rate and linearity, so that it can stably supply the fluid even through, for example, a narrow flow path having a large air flow resistance. This makes it possible to stably supply the fluid through the flow path thinned as a result of the downsizing and thinning of the flow path forming component, and thereby makes it possible to downsize and thin the power generation unit.

" In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a vaso-occlusive device having an agent delivery capability is provided. In one embodiment, the vaso-occlusive device includes a coil and an agent carrier disposed within a lumen of the coil. The agent carrier includes a bioactive material or agent that elicits a tissue reaction when placed inside a body. By way of non-limiting examples, the agent carrier can have an elongate shape, be in a form of a sphere, a cone, a plate, a mesh, or other customized shape. 
 The agent carrier can be made from a biodegradable material, in which case, the composition of the agent carrier includes a bioactive material or agent that is released when placed inside a body. The agent carrier can also be made from a non-biodegradable material, in which case, the bioactive material or agent is coated onto a surface of or incorporated within the agent carrier. In other embodiments, the agent carrier is made from a material that adheres or absorbs a bioactive agent. By way of non-limiting examples, the agent carrier can include one or more polymer filaments, a sponge, a tube, a cloth, or other materials that are capable of encompassing, absorbing or adhering a bioactive agent.

The transportation device is arranged to be located immediately laterally of the operating room table. 
 The system basically comprises a first inflatable member and a second inflatable member. The first inflatable member has a generally horizontally oriented patient supporting surface, a lateral inside edge and is arranged to be located on the movable transport device with the patient in a supine position on the patient supporting surface. The second inflatable member has a generally horizontally oriented patient receiving surface, a lateral inside edge and is arranged to be located on the operating room table and releasably coupled to the first inflatable member when the transportation device is located immediately laterally of the operating room table. The first inflatable member is arranged to be inflated to rotate the supine patient about an axis extending generally parallel to the lateral inside edge of the first inflatable member through an arc slightly in excess of 90 degrees. The second inflatable member is arranged to rotate the patient receiving surface through an arc slightly less than 90 degrees, whereupon the patient is transferred in a prone orientation to the patient receiving surface of the second inflatable member. The patient receiving surface of the second inflatable member is arranged to thereafter be rotated back to its initial horizontal orientation, whereupon the patient is prone on the operating room table. 
 In accordance with one exemplary aspect of this invention, once the patient has been placed in the prone position on the operating room table the first inflatable member can be uncoupled from the second inflatable member and it and the transportation device can be moved away from the operating room table to enable the operation on the patient to proceed.

An information display panel is coupled to the podium seating unit and located adjacent a rear of the podium seating unit. The display panel extends above the seating unit with its front surface being reachable over a back of the podium seating unit. By this arrangement, the seated presenter can maintain level eye contact with group members in an informal setting while discussing and pointing to information on the display panel. 
 In another aspect of the present invention, a podium seating unit adapted for informal collaboration and presentations includes a podium seating unit having a seat for a seated presenter, and an information display panel attached to the podium seating unit and located adjacent a rear of the podium seating unit. The display panel extends above the seating unit with its front surface being reachable over a back of the podium seating unit. By this arrangement, the seated presenter can maintain level eye contact with group members in an informal setting while discussing and pointing to information on the display panel. 
 In yet another aspect of the present invention, a seating unit includes a base, and a seat and a back supported on the base. A projector screen is attached to one of the base, back and seat. The screen extends above the back, and the back has a low height allowing a user sitting on the seat to reach over the back and point to projected images on the screen. 
 The present furniture system serves as an excellent focal point for a lounge-based meeting, where informal communication and collaboration is desired. The podium lounge seating unit provides comfortable seating for the presenter along with a handy tablet arm, secured storage, and a projection surface. A lockable storage drawer is available to secure projection equipment or presentation tools. The fixed tablet arm provides a surface for presenter's notes, laptop computer, or wireless mouse. Also, a cushion-engaging service tray accessory nests securely on the benches and podium seating units for food service and to support projection equipment in a lounge-based meeting space, and is movable along the cushions for optimal positioning. The podium seating unit includes an integrated projection screen attached to its rear area and which extends up above its low-height back. The projection screen is a fine white mesh, and provides a cleanable surface that allows light to filter through when the screen is used to divide space. The projection screen also accommodates Steelcase's Huddleboard™ marker board, which is an erasable board that can be hung on the screen and easily written on by a presenter sitting on the podium seating unit. The Huddleboard™ marker board is removable, and also is slidable along the screen for optimal positioning relative to the seated presenter. The back of the podium seating is particularly constructed to reduce a tendency to recline against the back screen, such as by its low height (which does not fully support a seated user's lumbar, and hence tends to cause a seated user to sit upright and/or forwardly) and also by its fore-to-aft thickness (which is sufficient to space a seated user away from the screen while still permitting full access for pointing or writing thereon). 
 The present furniture system further includes “bench” lounge seating units, which are more conventional in nature. Bridge tables are provided that extend between and interconnect adjacent bench lounge seating units, and which provide a place for users to rest food, writing supplies, and materials. Also, privacy screens are provided that attach to rear edges of the bridge tables, and that extend along linear tables or around corners defined by corner tables.

 Another important object of the invention is to provide a more flavorful juicier sliced ham product by cooking the ham at the customer's home in a browning bag provided as part of the display package. 
 Because the ham is pre-sliced and pre-glazed, further cooking may be accomplished in the browning bag in such a way as to utilize pre-seasoning with out loss of flavor as a result from applying seasoning after removing the ham from a shrink wrap package preparatory to further cooking. The most important advantage of the invention is convenience in home preparation and increased flavor resulting from cooking in the presentation bag.

" In a first broad aspect, the present invention provides a method for accurately determining the boundaries of an object such as a gel comprising the steps of:—



 a) creating a binary image of the object, the binary image having a central region, a boundary region, and an outside region with the boundary region encompassing the boundary of the object; and 
 b) performing a homotopic thinning of the binary image, iteratively until no more pixels can be removed. 




 For optimum results, where the object is a gel, the homotopic thinning iteration is based on a grey scale image of the gel edge and surrounding area, and most preferably based on an edge threshold image. Thus, in a preferred aspect of the present invention, step (b) comprises the steps of: 



 c) producing a grey scale edge image of the gel having high response values or intensity where local intensity changes are highest within the image; and 
 d) performing a grey scale controlled homotopic thinning of the binary image in which the pixels which can be removed homotopicaly from the binary image are ordered and the pixel which is removed is that which corresponds in location to the pixel which has the smallest edge/intensity value in the grey scale edge image of the gel. 




 This process is continued iteratively until no more pixels can be removed. 
 Various methods can be used to produce an edge image of the gel, including Sobel, dilation erosion or laplacian. 
 In one preferred embodiment step a) involves the following steps 



 i) creating a crude binary image of the gel and cleaning the image to remove noise to provide an image that depicts the gel segmented into one group with the background as a second group, with the one group including the gel and gel boundary areas; and 
 ii) subtracting an erosion of the binary image from a dilation of the binary image. 




 The method is particularly suited to edge detection where the object is a gel of the type used in the chromatography process referred to as gel electrophoresis, however it could be used in other applications where edge detection is required for image segmentation or locating objects. 
 Step b) may utilise any suitable edge detection method such as a sobel method.

" Embodiments of the invention thus encompass aspects of performing in situ dep/etch/dep processes. These embodiments are generally configured as processes in which the etch-back may be performed without separate plasma activation of the etchant gas. This feature results from the use of process-chamber configurations that allow the in situ process to proceed through the phases of deposition, etch, and deposition continuously. 
 In one set of embodiments, a continuous in situ process is provided using a plasma source disposed within the process chamber. In such embodiments, a first gaseous mixture is provided to the process chamber, from which a plasma is generated to deposit the first portion of the film. Thereafter, an etchant gas is flowed into the process chamber without terminating the plasma to etch the first portion of the film. Thereafter, a second gaseous mixture is provided to the process chamber without terminating the plasma to deposit the second portion of the film. As before, the gaseous mixtures may include silicon- and oxygen-containing gases to deposit a silicon oxide film, and the etchant gas may include a fluorine-containing gas such as NF3 or F2. In different embodiments, bias power may or may not be used. 
 In other embodiments, the first deposition phase may be combined with the etch phase of the process by providing a gaseous mixture to the process chamber that includes both a deposition gas and an etchant gas. A plasma is generated from the gaseous mixture with a plasma coupling structure to simultaneously deposit a first portion of the film on the substrate and etch the film. The plasma includes poloidal ion flow along field lines substantially parallel to a surface interior to the process chamber and disposed to separate the plasma from the plasma coupling structure. The etchant gas acts chemically and can be controlled more easily than can, for example, the physical sputter component of a high-density-plasma deposition process. These embodiments thus provide an improved level of control. 
 Subsequent to the combined deposition and chemical etching, a second gaseous mixture having a second deposition gas may be provided to the process chamber to deposit a second portion of the film. This second deposition gas may be substantially the same as the first deposition gas. The deposition gases may include a silicon-containing gas, such as SiH4, and an oxygen-containing gas, such as O2, to deposit a silicon oxide layer. The etchant gas may include a fluorine-containing gas, such as NF3 or F2, which reacts with the deposited silicon layer. 
 Some embodiments of the invention additionally include applying an electrical bias to the substrate during the combined deposition and etching phase. The power density for the electrical bias may be sufficiently low, <3.2 W/cm2, that the physical sputter component from a high-density plasma process is small. Instead, the bias acts to introduce an anisotropy in the action of the etchant that improves the overall deposition for certain features. In one embodiment, the bias power density is between 0.9 and 1.6 W/cm2. 
 The methods of the present invention may be embodied in a computer-readable storage medium having a computer-readable program embodied therein for directing operation of a substrate processing system. Such a system may include a process chamber, a plasma generation system, a substrate holder, a gas delivery system, and a system controller. The computer-readable program includes instructions for operating the substrate processing system to form a thin film on a substrate disposed in the processing chamber in accordance with the embodiments described above. 
 A further understanding of the nature and advantages of the present invention may be realized by reference to the remaining portions of the specification and the drawings.

" From at least some of the reference symbols received directly or indirectly in temporal succession in a receiver, a static component of the received reference symbol is determined by forming a statistical moment, which is for example an arithmetic mean. At least two reference symbols following each other either directly or indirectly in time are compared to determine a dynamic component of the received reference symbols. The static and the dynamic component of the reference symbols are then processed to determine a prediction value for the next reference symbol received. After reception of this next reference symbol a prediction error is determined comparing by the received reference symbol with the prediction value, and ascertaining from the prediction error an estimate for the noise of a data signal transmitted in a transmission channel. The calculation of the prediction value is adapted to temporal changes in the transmission channel, taking into account the prediction error. 
 This produces a motion-compensated noise estimate in which the outcome of the estimate is not affected by a time variance of the transmission channel due to the relative motion between the transmitter and the receiver. Consequently, a more precise reconstruction of the original data signal can be achieved, so that the quality of the data signal reconstructed at the receiving end is improved. 
 These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent in light of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.
","1. Method for motion-compensated noise evaluation for mobile wireless transmission systems, in which reference symbols (14, 16) are sent out by a transmitter (1), with the following features: 
from at least some of the reference symbols ({overscore (s)}−1, {overscore (s)}−2, {overscore (s)}−3) following each other directly or indirectly in time and received in a receiver (2), a static component ({overscore (s)}avg) of the received reference symbols ({overscore (s)}−1, {overscore (s)}−2, {overscore (s)}−3) is determined by forming a statistical moment; 
a dynamic component (smotion) of the received reference symbols ({overscore (s)}−1, {overscore (s)}−2, {overscore (s)}−3) is determined by comparing at least two directly or indirectly time-consecutive reference symbols ({overscore (s)}−μ, {overscore (s)}−1); 
from the static ({overscore (s)}avg) and the dynamic component ({overscore (s)}motion) of the received reference symbols ({overscore (s)}−1, {overscore (s)}−2, {overscore (s)}−3) a prediction value ({overscore (s)}pred) is computed for the next reference symbol ({overscore (s)}0) received; 
after receiving the next reference symbol ({overscore (s)}0), this received reference symbol ({overscore (s)}0) is compared to the prediction value ({overscore (s)}pred) to determine a prediction error ({overscore (s)}err); 
from the prediction error ({overscore (s)}err) an estimate is determined for the noise (Pnoise) of a data signal transmitted in a transmission channel (5); 
and by taking account of the prediction error ({overscore (s)}err), the calculation of the prediction ({overscore (s)}pred) is adapted to time changes in the transmission channel."
" The invention aims to provide a solution to this problem. 
 It is an object of the invention to propose an effective means of protecting the electronic component from electrostatic discharges, while minimizing potential noise transmission via these electrostatic discharge protection means. 
 The invention therefore proposes an electronic component comprising an integrated circuit incorporating several separate functional blocks within a semiconductor substrate, and electrostatic discharge protection means. 
 According to a general feature of the invention, the electrostatic discharge protection means comprise several separate metal discharge rails placed above the substrate and respectively associated with the plurality of functional blocks, all these metal discharge rails being mutually unconnected electrically within the integrated circuit but connected electrically via an electrical connection external to the integrated circuit to one and the same ground plane forming a ground reference for the electrostatic discharges, this ground plane being located outside the integrated circuit. 
 In other words, the invention provides a complete inter-rail brake within the integrated circuit and consequently there is isolation between the metal rails. However, the DC electrical continuity needed for electrostatic discharge protection is provided by this electrical connection external to the integrated circuit and by the external ground plane. 
 The invention is also noteworthy in the sense that, although the integrated circuit in itself is not protected against electrostatic discharges, this protection is acquired once the integrated circuit is coupled to the ground plane external to the integrated circuit. 
 Advantageously, the ground plane is a metal plate having one face visible when the integrated circuit is encapsulated in its package. 
 Thus, although the integrated circuit, that is to say for example the silicon chip, is not intrinsically protected against electrostatic discharges, this protection is acquired after the integrated circuit has been encapsulated in its package, that is to say after packaging. Thus, the electronic component, comprising the integrated circuit encapsulated in its package and the metal plate having one face located on the outside of the package, is intrinsically protected against electrostatic discharges. 
 The external metal connection between the discharge rails and the external ground plane may be produced, for example, by bonding wires connected, on the one hand, to the various metal discharge rails via contact pads and, on the other hand, to the external ground plane. 
 The presence of such bonding wires, which are generally inductive, helps to minimize noise transmission as they carry out a first filtering operation. 
 Moreover, the metal plate forming the said external ground plane may be a heat slug placed beneath the integrated circuit. A heat slug is a relatively thick metal plate. The separate metal discharge rails are then connected to the heat slug via separate electrical wires. 
 Thus, according to this embodiment, a standard means, namely the heat slug, used for other functions, in this case for dissipating heat, is used to form the external ground plane. 
 Moreover, a heat slug generally has low impedance and thus forms a cold spot, that is to say a path of minimum impedance, allowing in particular the charges to be discharged via this means. 
 For radiofrequency applications in particular, the integrated circuit may be advantageously fixed to a thin metal plate that acts as a ground reference for the radiofrequency signals. This thin metal plate is also called an “exposed pad” by those skilled in the art. When an integrated circuit is coupled to a heat slug, the heat slug is fixed beneath the said exposed pad. 
 By doing this, when there is no heat slug, the metal plate forming the said external ground plane acting as ground reference for the electrostatic discharges may consist of the said exposed pad acting as ground reference for the radiofrequency signals. 
 Thus, once again, a means normally used for other functions is used to form the external ground plane.

" What is disclosed is a tailings conveyor which threshes tailings as they are conveyed therethrough, so as to provide one or more of the capabilities and overcome one or more of the limitations and shortcomings set forth above. 
 According to one aspect of the invention, the tailings conveyor includes a housing including an interior cavity, an inlet opening connecting with the cavity for receiving tailings from the cleaning system into the cavity, and an outlet opening for discharging the tailings from the cavity. The conveyor includes a first rotary impeller supported for rotation about a first rotational axis in the cavity at a position adjacent to the inlet opening and an interior surface of the housing, the first impeller including a plurality of blades extending radially outwardly from a first hub to radial outer threshing portions or tips of the blades, and a first drive connected in driving relation to the first hub for rotating the first impeller such that the threshing portions or tips thereof will rotate at a predetermined first rotational speed or within a first rotational speed range. In operation, during the rotation, the threshing portions will accelerate and propel tailings received into the interior along a predetermined path therein, including against others of the tailings and against and along the interior surface for threshing the tailings. The conveyor includes a second rotary impeller supported for rotational about a second rotational axis in the cavity at a location downstream along the path from the first impeller, the second impeller including a plurality of blades extending radially outwardly from a second hub to radial outer threshing portions or tips of the blades, and a second drive connected in driving relation to the second hub for rotating the second impeller such that the threshing portions or tips will rotate at a predetermined second rotational speed greater than the first rotational speed. As a result of the greater rotational speed of the second impeller, the second impeller will further accelerate and propel the tailings against others of the tailings and against and along the interior surface and along the path for threshing the tailings, such that the tailings are progressively accelerated relative to their initial speed and are threshed as they are conveyed through the conveyor. 
 According to another preferred aspect of the invention, the first and second impellers are positioned in such that the radial outer threshing portions thereof counter rotate in closely spaced relation in a portion of the interior cavity so as to define a boundary of a conveying region of the cavity through which a portion of the predetermined path extends and in which it is desired for the tailings to be substantially contained. This is to prevent or significantly reduce the occurrence of build up of tailings in the region between the impellers which could lead to clogging and a reduction in the efficiency and throughput capacity of the conveyor. 
 According to another preferred aspect of the invention, the conveyor includes a third rotary impeller supported for rotation about a third rotational axis in the cavity at a location downstream along the path from the first and second impellers, the third impeller including a plurality of blades extending radially outwardly from a third hub to radial outer threshing portions, and a third drive connected in driving relation to the third hub for rotating the third impeller such that the threshing portions thereof will rotate at a predetermined third rotational speed greater than the second rotational speed and will further accelerate and propel the tailings against others of the tailings and against and along the interior surface and along the path for further threshing the tailings, and outwardly from the housing through the outlet opening. Alternatively, in the absence of the third impeller, the second impeller can be positioned for discharging the tailings through the outlet opening. 
 By rotating the radial outer threshing portions or tips of the blades of two or more successive impellers at progressively greater rotational speeds, that is, rotating the tips of the blades of successive ones of the impellers at speeds faster than the previous ones, the tailings are progressively accelerated. This, in combination with propelling the tailings in the turbulent manner, and by propelling the tailings against and along the interior surface of the housing and into the path of rotation of the next successive one of the impellers, has been found to reduce hesitation in the movement of the tailings through the conveyor while providing sufficient movements and collisions of the tailings for causing separation of grain, beans, seeds, kernels, and the like grain, which are desired to be collected, from husks, cobs, pods, stems, hulls and other portions of the plants being harvested.

" In the technique that is disclosed in Laid-open European Patent Application No. 0672985, consistency of the copy of data stored in the target storage system cannot be maintained unless the host computer applies a write time to the write data, since the write sequence is maintained using the write time applied to the write data by the host computer when the write data from the host computer is reflected to the target storage system. In the case of a so-called mainframe host computer, the write time is applied to the write request, but, in the case of a so-called open system host computer, the write time is not applied to the write request. Consequently, in the technique disclosed in Laid-open European Patent Application No. 0672985, consistency of the copy of the data stored in the target storage system with I/O from an open system host computer cannot be maintained. 
 Also in the case of U.S. Pat. No. 6,092,066 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,209,002, there is no disclosure concerning maintenance of consistency of a copy of data stored in a target storage system when the host computers include an open system host computer. 
 Accordingly, in a computer system in which data that is employed by computer is stored in a storage system and the data that is stored in this storage system is transferred to a separate storage system so that a copy of the data is also held in this separate storage system, there is herein disclosed a technique for maintaining consistency of the copy of the data stored in the separate storage system (i.e. the target storage system) even in respect of data written to the storage system by a host computer that does not apply a write time to the write data, such as an open system host computer. 
 The system comprises a first storage device system having a first logical volume coupled to a computer and in which data received from the computer is stored and a second storage device system coupled to the first storage device system and having a second logical volume in which a copy of data stored in the first logical volume is stored. 
 The first storage device system applies time information to the write data received from the computer and sends the write data and this time information to the second storage device system; the second storage device system stores the write data received from the first storage device system in the second logical volume in accordance with the time information applied to this write data. 
 In a computer system in which data that is employed by computer is stored in a storage system and the data that is stored in this storage system is transferred to a separate storage system so that a copy of the data is also held in this separate storage system, it is thereby possible to maintain consistency of the copy of the data that is stored in the separate storage system (target storage system), even in the case of data stored in the storage system by a host computer that does not apply the write time to the write data, such as an open system host computer.
","1. A system for copying data between a plurality of storage systems, comprising: 
a first storage system coupled to a plurality of computers, which comprises a first logical volume storing data received from the plurality of computers; and 
a second storage system coupled to said first storage system, which comprises a second logical volume storing copy data of data stored in said first logical volume; 
wherein said first storage system assigns time information to write data received from the plurality of computers and sends the write data and the time information to said second storage system; and 
said second storage system stores the write data received from said first storage system in said second logical volume in an order based on the time information assigned to the write data."
" The present invention provides an improved system for needs-based buying and/or selling. The invention provides a systematic way to solicit and analyze a consumer's objective and subjective needs for goods and services and provide an array of choices of goods, services, prices and sources that meet the consumer's needs. 
 It is an object of the invention to overcome limitations of the current methods of buying goods and services on an interactive electronic basis. These goods or services can include any tangible good or service ranging from toothpaste to antiques, to airline tickets, mail services, mutual funds, insurance or travel services. It is another object of this invention to provide easy access to consumers over an electronic terminal to an expert system that can analyze their product and individual needs, provide information and recommendations on price ranges versus product and individual trade-offs, and, based on consumer choice, direct them to providers of the goods and services. It is a further object of this invention to identify bids that the buyer might make in an “auction” with various probabilities of successfully obtaining the goods or services that he or she wants and meeting individual needs for availability and other criteria, all at the price he or she is willing to pay. 
 It is another object of this invention to provide a system and method for identifying consumers' needs and matching them with sellers who can satisfy those needs through a remote terminal connecting to a host computer over an on-line network. The system, through a simple interactive step-by-step process, allows the customer to precisely match his or her needs to the provider's product, service and price. Unlike database marketing, which assists the provider in attempting to identify customers ready to buy his product or service, this system creates a customer-controlled match between consumer needs and provider. When the customer chooses to use the system to contact the provider, the customer is fully qualified and at the point of purchase. 
 These objects and others are achieved through a method and apparatus of analyzing the consumer's needs, identifying the purchase options, and either referring the consumer to sellers that can match those needs through data terminals, telephones, and computers connected to an on-line communications network, or to a sponsor conducting “auction” sales through data terminals and computers connected to an on-line communications network. The system has access to available vendor information, price quotes, and successful “auction” price behaviors. 
 The above and other objects of the invention will become readily apparent to those of skill in the relevant art from the following detailed description and figures, wherein only the preferred embodiments of the invention are shown and described, simply by way of illustration of the best mode of carrying out the invention. As is readily recognized the invention is capable of modifications within the skill of the relevant art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
","1. A system for advising a consumer how much to pay for goods and services comprising: 
a user interface for allowing a customer to access a host computer via an on-line network, 
a host computer which solicits a consumer's objective and subjective criteria for the purchase of goods or services in an interactive, intuitive manner, 
wherein based on the consumer's needs and access to available data on goods or services, the system generates at least one of options, recommendations, referrals to providers of goods or services, and prices of goods or services, 
and means for presenting information to the customer."

" A current-mode instrumentation amplifier is presented which overcomes the problems noted above, providing high DC precision with a small die area. 
 The present IA employs a current-mode topology. The IA includes first and second input terminals (VINP, VINN) which receive a differential voltage Vin=VINP−VINN, a resistor having a resistance R1, and first and second buffer amplifiers which receive the differential voltage and provide first and second output voltages V1 and V2 at respective output nodes which vary with VINP and VINN, respectively. With reference to FIG. 2, the first amplifier includes a first transistor (MN1) biased with a bias current Ibias1=I3−I1 and connected between V1 and a circuit common point, and the second amplifier includes a second transistor (MN2) biased with a bias current Ibias2=I4-I2 and connected between V2 and the circuit common point. 
 R1 is connected between the first and second output nodes such that it conducts a current IR1 that varies with Vin. When so arranged, the first transistor conducts a current Ia=Ibias1−IR1 when VINP>VINN and a current Ia=Ibias1+IR1 when VINP<VINN, and the second transistor conducts a current Ib=Ibias2−IR1 when VINN>VINP and a current Ib=Ibias2+IR1 when VINN<VINP. Circuitry is provided which couples current Ia to the current input terminal of a current mirror, and couples current Ib to the mirror's current output terminal—which also serves as the IA's current output node. To develop an output voltage, a resistance R2 is typically connected between the current output node and circuit common, and a buffer amplifier connected to the current output node provides the IA's output voltage Vout. Because each of the first and second transistors carries the signal current in R1, the current in R2 is twice that in R1. Consequently, the gain G of the IA is given by: G=2*(R2/R1) (assuming a current mirror ratio of 1:1). To minimize DC mismatch errors, the present IA is preferably chopper-stabilized and/or auto-zeroed; when chopper-stabilized, both the buffer amplifiers and signal current paths are chopped using a two-phase chopping cycle. 
 Currents Ia and Ib are preferably coupled to the current mirror using virtual ground nodes which fold the currents in the first and second transistors around to the output node. When so arranged, the IA requires only the one current mirror described above, instead of the multiple mirrors (and their attendant errors) found in prior art IA designs. 
 In another embodiment of the invention, the buffer amplifiers are arranged such that the amplifier coupled to VINP produces a signal current Ivinp equal to (VINP−VINN)/R1 and the amplifier coupled to VINN produces a signal current Ivinn equal to (VINN−VINP)/R1. The IA includes a single current mirror having input and output terminals. Signal currents Ivinp and Ivinn are folded to respective current mirror terminals using, for example, respective transistors or virtual ground nodes; the current mirror's output terminal serves as the IA's current output node. With R2 and a reference voltage Vref connected in series between the current output node and a circuit common point, the IA has a gain G given by: G=2*(R2/R1) and an output voltage at the current output node given by 2*((VINP−VINN)/R1)*R2+Vref. Due to the folding of the buffer amplifier currents, only one current mirror is required, while maintaining good common mode rejection versus frequency. This reduces DC errors such as Vos and dVos/dT, etc. 
 Further features and advantages of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, taken together with the accompanying drawings.
","1. A current-mode instrumentation amplifier (IA), comprising: 
first and second input terminals connected to receive a differential voltage (VINP−VINN);

" The first embodiment of the invention is a transporter for carrying a payload over a surface. The transporter includes a surface-contacting module, a power base and a support for a payload. The power base is pivotally coupled to the surface-contacting module and the support is pivotally coupled to the power base. The surface-contacting module to which the present invention refers contains at least two surface-contacting elements, such as wheels, and also any structure, such as a cluster arm, for supporting those surface-contacting elements that are in contact with the surface at any particular instant. The power base serves to mechanically couple the surface-contacting module to the payload support.

In a specific embodiment of the invention, the rest is a footrest for a passenger on the transporter and the support includes a seat for the passenger. The rest is pivotally coupled to the support and power base through a four-bar linkage. In another embodiment, the rest coupled to the support and the powerbase, includes a follower, such as a roller follower, that is fixed with respect to the rest and movable with respect to the power base. The follower transfers part of the load from the rest to the support and/or the power base. The four-bar linkage transfers part of the load from the rest to support and to the powerbase through the lifting arm. The load transfer permits the power base to absorb some of the “shock” which would otherwise need to be borne wholly by the rest or the support, during a front impact to the rest. 
 In a further specific embodiment of the invention wherein the rest includes a follower, the power base is shaped so that the angle the rest makes with a vertical plane is determined by the rotation of the power base. This rest angle remains constant as the power base rotates until a specific power base rotation angle is attained. The specific angle corresponds to a minimum height of the support above the surface. When the power base is rotated beyond the specific angle, the rest tucks towards the power base. The increased height above the surface of the support and the rest allows the “tucked” rest to continue to clear the surface. This embodiment and the embodiment with the four-bar linkage, advantageously increases the maneuverability of the transporter by tucking the rest inward towards the ground contacting elements, thus, reducing the swing radius of the transporter. 
 In another specific embodiment of the invention, dual footrests are provided. The control mechanism linking the support height to the rotation of the power base, through the four-bar linkage, can differ for each footrest. Accordingly, it is possible to have independent control mechanisms for each footrest. Alternatively, when using the footrest with a follower, the profile of the power base, where the followers for the respective footrests contact the base can differ for each of the two footrests. This power base profile allows the tucking behavior of one footrest to be tailored differently from the behavior of the other footrest. 
 In another specific embodiment of the invention, a separate and independent motor is provided to drive a footrest. The motor can drive the coupled footrest to correspondingly move with respect to the power base or support height. With dual footrests, separate and independent motors can provide independent control of each footrest, thus, the footrests correspondingly move with respect to the power base or support height. Accordingly, the motors can enable separate and independent tucking movements for each footrest.

" Techniques for scheduling measurements for cells in multiple wireless communication systems (e.g., GSM and W-CDMA systems) are described herein. To achieve good performance, GSM and W-CDMA neighbor cells are prioritized to determine which cell to measure in each frame available for measurement (e.g., each idle frame in GSM). 
 The GSM neighbor cells are categorized based on a number of states. Each state is associated with information indicating, for example, whether or not timing information and cell identification have been obtained for a cell. The states are prioritized in a manner to achieve good performance. The GSM neighbor cells are thus assigned different priorities depending on their states. The W-CDMA neighbor cells are prioritized relative to the states for the GSM neighbor cells. Since W-CDMA cells are stateless, as described below, all of the W-CDMA neighbor cells can be assigned the same state, given the same priority, and considered as “one” W-CDMA cell in the measurement scheduling. A cell in the GSM or W-CDMA system is selected based on the priorities of the neighbor cells, and the selected cell is scheduled for measurement in the next idle frame. The highest-ranking GSM or W-CDMA cell for each idle frame is thus granted use of that idle frame for measurement.

" It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a device which allows setting the direction of the stream of water exiting from the device, without a jet-shaped narrowing of the flow cross-section. It is another object of the invention to provide a device that is structured in a simple manner in terms of design, and is easy to assemble. 
 This object is accomplished according to the invention by a device having a guide element that is configured as a guide vane ring and has a ring-shaped bearing shell at the outer end of the guide vanes, which shell is held in place, so as to move, between a glide surface of the accommodation device that is configured as a sphere surface segment, and a concave contact surface of the rosette. The guide vane ring guarantees precise deflection of the massage jet that exits from the device, into the desired direction, even at great pivot angles. During assembly, the guide element is simply set upon the sphere surface segment, and the rosette is subsequently screwed onto the accommodation device. Preferably, the rosette has a ring-shaped connection ridge provided with an inside thread and an outside thread, which interacts with an attachment ridge on the accommodation device and attaches the rosette on the accommodation device. By appropriate tightening of the screw connection, the clamping force of the guide vane ring can be precisely adjusted. The bearing shell can comprise a sleeve that interacts with the sphere surface segment and is fitted into an accommodation ring of the bearing shell that is molded onto the outer ends of the guide vanes. Preferably, the guide vane ring has an inner ring having a center passage opening, onto which the guide vanes are molded on, on the outside. Flow guide elements can be arranged in the passage opening of the inner ring, which elements are molded onto the inner ring. The flow guide elements contribute to rectification of the flow as it flows through the passage opening, and hereby guide the flow into a direction parallel to the axis of the guide vane ring. The flow guide elements themselves, in turn, can comprise a ring-shaped ridge having a wall thickness that increases in the flow direction, so that the flow is correspondingly accelerated in this region. A displacement profile, the thickness of which also increases in the flow direction, can be arranged in the center, within this ridge. The guide vanes, the ring-shaped ridges, as well as the flow guide elements can be configured as a one-piece injection-molded part. 
 Preferably, the pivot position can be changed via pressure on the guide vane ring, and the guide vane ring remains in a desired position because of its elastic behavior. The elastic behavior is achieved by selecting an appropriately suitable material of the sleeve and/or of the remainder of the guide vane ring. Preferably, the rosette is structured in multiple parts, and has an outer ring provided with the inflow openings, as well as an inner attachment ring having the outlet opening, which is connected with the outer ring.

The air flows through an air channel arranged in the hub after leaving the flow channel, and flows through the outlet opening together with the stream of water.

A reflux preventer can be provided ahead of the air inflow opening of the flow channel, to which an air intake tap is connected upstream. The air feed can preferably be optionally turned on and off by a valve connected to an operating element, or a separate rotary knob.

" An objective of the invention is to provide an organic light-emitting panel, in which the heat dissipation paths may be increased and the radiation area may be enlarged so as to avoid warpage of the rear board and facilitate the adhesive dispensing process, and a manufacturing method of the panel.

" One object of the present invention is to provide a method of fabricating SOI structures with a very thin (less than 100 nm), but uniform buried oxide. 
 Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of fabricating SOI structures in which the processing time is reduced, yet the throughput is increased by reducing the oxygen implantation dose to a level below which is allowed for in a typical SIMOX process. 
 An even further object of the present invention is to provide a method of fabricating SOI structures where the defect level in the Si over-layer, i.e., the SOI layer, is reduced by reducing implantation damages and by reducing the stresses and strains from the expanding volume of the buried oxide. 
 These and other objects and advantages are achieved in the present invention by utilizing a method wherein a low-dose oxygen implantation step is performed. By “low-dose”, it is meant an oxygen dose of about 1E17 atoms/cm2 or less. In prior art SIMOX processes, a low-dose oxygen implantation would usually result in a layer of broken and discontinuous buried oxides as the oxide tends to ball up to minimize surface energy. In the present invention, the problem is solved by forming a large number of vacancies or voids in a Si-containing substrate prior to the low-dose oxygen implantation step. 
 The vacancies or voids coalesce during the subsequent high-temperature oxidation and provide room for the buried oxide to expand laterally, resulting in a thin, uniform buried oxide layer. The term “uniform” is used in the present invention to denote a buried oxide region having a continuous interface with the Si-containing over-layer as well as the underlying Si-containing substrate wherein the variation of thickness across the entire wafer is less than 30% of the total thickness of the buried oxide layer. With a sufficient density of vacancies or voids, the thickness of the buried oxide layer is mostly dependent on the implanted dose and the internal thermal oxidation conditions. In one embodiment of the present invention, the vacancies or voids are formed into a Si-containing substrate by utilizing an electrolytic anodization process wherein a HF-containing solution is used. 
 In accordance with the method of the present invention, the SOI structure is fabricated by modifying a surface of a Si-containing substrate to contain a large concentration (on the order of about 0.01% or greater) of vacancies or voids. The terms “vacancies” and “voids” are interchangeably used in the present invention to denote a porous Si region. Next, a Si-containing layer is typically, but not always, formed atop the substrate and then oxygen ions are implanted into the structure utilizing a low-oxygen dose. The structure is then annealed to convert the implanted oxygen ions into a thin, but uniform thermal buried oxide region. 
 In broad terms, the method of the present invention comprises the steps of: 



 providing a structure comprising at least a Si-containing substrate that has a region of vacancies or voids located therein; 
 optionally forming a single crystal Si-containing layer atop said structure; 
 implanting oxygen ions into said structure using an oxygen dose of about 1E17 atoms/cm2 or less; and 
 annealing the structure containing implanted oxygen ions and vacancies or voids to form a silicon-on-insulator that includes a Si-containing over-layer and a buried oxide, said buried oxide having a thickness of about 100 nm or less. 




 In some embodiments of the present invention, a bake step conducted in a hydrogen-containing ambient is employed prior to the optional forming a single crystal Si-containing layer over the porous structure or prior to the implanting step. 
 In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a baking step performed in a hydrogen-containing atmosphere is employed to the SOI structure which includes the thin buried oxide layer. 
 The SOI structure obtained from the present invention contains a very thin, yet uniform and continuous buried oxide region.

" The present invention has been made to solve the above problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacturing a gallium nitride-based single crystal substrate, which uses a ZnO substrate having a low lattice parameter difference with the gallium nitride-based single crystal and a crystal structure identical to that of the gallium nitride-based single crystal, and which employs a crystal growth method having two steps combining a process for growing the crystal and a process for removing the ZnO substrate, thereby minimizing problems caused by stresses. 
 In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, the above and other objects can be accomplished by the provision of a method of manufacturing a gallium nitride-based single crystal substrate comprising the steps of: a) preparing a zinc oxide (ZnO) substrate; b) primarily growing a gallium nitride-based (AlxInyGa(1-x-y)N, where 0≦x≦1, 0≦y≦1, 0≦x+y≦1) single crystal layer on the ZnO substrate; and c) secondarily growing an additional gallium nitride-based single crystal layer on the primarily grown gallium nitride-based single crystal layer, while removing the ZnO substrate by etching the underside of the ZnO substrate. 
 The gallium nitride-based single crystal layer may be grown using an HVPE process. 
 The step c) may be executed at a temperature higher than that of the step b). Specifically, the temperature of the step b) may be in a range of about 50° C.˜600° C., and the temperature of the step c) may be in a range of about 900° C.˜1,150° C.

 The method of the present invention may further comprise the step of lapping the underside of the gallium nitride-based single crystal, from which the ZnO substrate is removed, to remove the underside by a predetermined thickness, after the step c). The underside of the gallium nitride-based single crystal may be removed by a thickness approximately the same as the thickness of the primarily grown gallium nitride single crystal layer.

 In order to achieve these characteristics, the present invention employs a primary growth process of growing the gallium nitride-based single crystal layer having a thickness smaller than that of a desired single crystal layer on the ZnO substrate, and a secondary growth process of regrowing the gallium nitride-based single crystal layer to have a desired thickness of the single crystal layer, while removing the ZnO substrate by etching the underside thereof.

" Certain objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description that follows and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned with the practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. 
 To achieve certain advantages and novel features, the present invention is generally directed to an apparatus and method for performing a unique searching and/or sorting algorithm. In accordance with one embodiment, a searching algorithm is implemented by performing a digit-by-digit comparison of a received number with a directory of stored numbers, by comparing digits in a generally right to left (or least significant to most significant) direction.

" In view of this, an object of the invention is to provide a stator structure easy to create starting offset for a motor. 
 According to the invention, a stator structure includes a stack of at least one first magnetic conductive plate and at least one second magnetic conductive plate. Each magnetic conductive plate has a plurality of radial arms and pole teeth provided on ends of the radial arms, and each pole tooth has a first and a second side portions substantially symmetrical to each other with respect to the radial arm. The second magnetic conductive plate is identical with the first one except the first side portion of the second magnetic conductive plate is formed with a cut, and the first and second magnetic conductive plates are stacked in a manner that the magnetic center of a rotor in relation to each pole tooth is closer to the second side portion than the first one. The magnetic conductive plates may be silicon steel sheets. 
 Through the design of the invention, since all the magnetic conductive plates have identical radii R, from center to the outer periphery, the stator structure formed of a stack of them can keep the same small gap apart from the rotor to have larger torque and improved efficiency. Further, since the two sets of the magnetic conductive plates are pre-designed to have the mere difference of the cut, when the offset angle θ is needed to be adapt to a different rotational speed, load or threshold voltages, the adjustment of the offset angle θ accompanied by the alternation to the magnetic action area is easy to be achieved only by varying the respective numbers of the first and second magnetic conductive plates in a stack. Thereby, the magnetic conductive plate is not needed to be replaced with a new one to change the starting offset, and thus the manufacture cost and labor time are considerably reduced.

A stator structure comprising at least one first magnetic conductive plate and at least one second magnetic conductive plate, each magnetic conductive plate having a plurality of radial arms and pole tooth provided on ends of the radial arms, wherein the pole teeth of the first and second magnetic conductive plates have different shapes."
" The invention resides in a system, method and computer program product for recovering from a failure of a computing device. Start up of a first component of the device is monitored and a determination is made whether the first component has started successfully. If so, a second, higher level component of the device is started. Operational data received from the second component is monitored. If the operational data falls outside of an operational boundary, an action is performed on the second component to enable the second component to operate within a preferred operational boundary. 
 According to features of the present invention, if the first component does not start up successfully, a determination is made if start up of the first component is critical to operation of the second component. If so, a corrective action is performed relative to the first component and afterwards, an attempt is made to start up the second component. 
 In one implementation of the present invention, there is a first recovery component which monitors the start up of each low level component and records the status of each low level component in a state table. The state table indicates if a component is running or not running. If a component is not running, the first recovery component performs a lookup in the state table to determine if a failed component is critical to the continued operation of the device. If the failed component is critical to the continued operation of the device, the first recovery component may shut down all running components and send a message to a centralized system requesting help. If the failed component is not critical to continued operation of the device, the first recovery component may still provide a guarantee to the second recovery component that the low level environment is secure. A secure and trusted environment may be needed for subsequent recovery program components to operate. Once the first recovery component is satisfied that all low level components which are required to enable the device to operate, are successfully operating, the first recovery component sends a message to the second recovery component to ask it to start. In response, the second recovery component loads from a data store one or more health records and actions. A health record is created in the data store for each application required to run on the device. By loading the health records in to a health table stored in memory, the second recovery component is able to ascertain which application to start. Programmed rules also dictate which applications and associated health records are required. Before loading other applications as defined by the rules and the health records, the second recovery component sends a message back to the first recovery component requesting the ‘hand over’ of recovery control from the first recovery component to the second recovery component. A ‘hand over’ will not typically take place unless the first recovery component can ensure the low level environment is secure and robust. If the low level environment is not secure and robust, the first recovery component will typically request assistance. If upon launching the second recovery component, the second recovery component is unable to start, the first recovery component may power down all low level components and request assistance. Preferably, applications are launched by the second recovery component according to one or more rules stored in a data store. Preferably, each component launched by the second component sends a message to the second recovery component. The message comprises operational data indicative of the operational status of the device. The operational data is extracted from the message and updated in the component's health record. Further messages are sent to the second recovery component every x number of seconds or milliseconds, for example. A rule is associated with a health record. Preferably, the rule determines if the operational data extracted from the message falls outside of an operational boundary. If the operational data falls outside of the operational boundary, the rule triggers an action to be performed. The action may be, for example, to restart a component, shut down another component that may be attributing to the problem or perform an upgrade. Preferably the action performed is recorded in the component's health record. Further actions may be performed, in a sequential or cascaded manner, in response to subsequent operational data being recorded in the component's health record.

" An apparatus is provided for modifying a timing signal generated by a timing signal generator. The timing signal is modified indirectly by first modifying a power supply signal from a power supply upon which the timing signal generator is dependent to generate the timing signal. Initiating an introduction of at least one transient signal component of variable length into the power supply signal by using a transient insertion device causes the timing signal generator to be disrupted and at least one transient signal component to be introduced into the timing signal. 
 Activation of a trigger mechanism supplies an input to a transient component generator. The transient component generator generates a modified power supply signal that is used to power the timing signal generator. The timing signal output of the timing signal generator is therefore also modified in sympathy with the transient component generator. 
 A transient component duration adjuster supplies an input to the transient component generator. The transient component duration adjuster input controls a duration of at least one transient signal component which is generated by the transient component generator. 
 The transient component generator uses inputs supplied from the transient component trigger and the transient component duration adjuster to create the modified power supply signal which is used in modifying the timing signal output by the timing signal generator. 
 An output from the transient component generator is used by a transient detector to provide visible notification that the transient component generator has generated the modified power supply signal which is used in modifying the timing signal output by the timing signal generator.

 Another object of the present invention is to provide a pixel for an FFS-LCD with reduced mask steps to manufacture therefore. 
 In a pixel for an FFS-LCD, according to the present invention, on a substrate an ultra-micro scattering layer with a top surface in a nano-scale roughness resulted from the crystallization or the property of the material within the ultra-micro scattering layer is formed, and a reflective layer is then formed on the ultra-micro scattering layer to be conformal to the top surface, so as to obtain a reflective surface in a nano-scale roughness thereon. As a result, no additional mask steps are required for the reflective surface to have scattering effect, thereby reducing the manufacturing cost. Moreover, the nano-scale roughness of the reflective surface improves the efficiency of reflecting light because of the reduced optical-path difference And thereof and larger scattering angle and smooth distribution for the scattering effect. Accordingly, the reflectivity of the LCD will not vary violently with the viewing angle, and excellent anti-glare effect is obtained additionally.

Furthermore, because the total reflection effect of the lights inside the light guide apparatus, the light energy of the light source is evenly distributed, and the micro structures formed on the light emerging structure changes the total reflection balance to guide the lights to predetermined area to emit to the outer environment. That is, by the guiding function of the light guide apparatus, the light energy of different light sources can be evenly distributed and compensated. Therefore, under the circumstance of part of the light sources fail, the light guide apparatus of the present invention having the function mentioned above can solve the problems of low luminance areas caused by the failure of the said lights and the unevenly luminance of the whole apparatus, thereby adjusting the light luminance distribution and enhancing the light source utilization efficiency which do not need to apply the complicated reflecting structures of the prior arts.

" In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a low cost fingerprint identification system and method is provided. More specifically, the present invention relates to reconstructing a fingerprint image from a plurality of frames of image data, obtained from a swipe sensor fingerprint identification system. Each frame comprises a plurality of lines with each line comprising a plurality of pixels. 
 The frames are transferred to a host where the fingerprint image is reconstructed. After a first frame FI is stored in a reconstructed image matrix (denoted I), the new data portion of each subsequent frame is stored in the image matrix until a complete image of the fingerprint is obtained. 
 The fingerprint image reconstruction process of the present invention determines how many lines in each frame is new data. This determination is based on a motion estimate that is obtained for each frame after the first frame. To reduce computational overhead, the motion estimate process initially decimates each frame by reducing the number of pixels in each row. Decimation reduces subsequent computational requirements without reducing resolution in motion estimation and enables real-time processing even if system resources are limited. The decimated frame is then normalized and a correlation process determines the amount of overlap between consecutive frames. The correlation process generates a delay factor that indicates how many new lines have moved into each frame relative to the immediately preceding frame. The correlation process continues until there are no further frames to add to the reconstructed matrix. 
 The present invention further provides an enrollment mode and an identification mode. The enrollment mode is used to build a database of templates that represent authorized or known individuals. In the identification mode, a fingerprint image is processed and compared to templates in the database. If a match is found, the user is authenticated. If no match is found, that condition is noted and the user is provided the opportunity to enroll. A user interface is used to assist the user in use of the system. 
 Because the fingerprint image is reconstructed from a plurality of frames of data, and because of the potential for poor image quality arising from improper orientation, improper speed of a swipe or for other reasons, the present invention includes an image quality check to make sure that the image contains adequate information to arrive at a user identification. Further, to minimize computational resources, the present invention further crops the reconstructed frame, removes noise components and then extracts a small, core portion of the fingerprint. The core portion of the fingerprint image is used to generate a template for the database when the system is operating in the enrollment mode. When the system is operating in the identification mode, the core portion is compared to the template to determine if there is a match. 
 Advantageously, the reconstructed method efficiently converts the frames of a finger scan into an accurate image of the fingerprint. Then, once the image is obtained, the enrollment and identification modes are well suited for implementation in portable electronic devices such as cellular telephones, PDAs, portable computers or other electronic devices. These and other features as well as advantages that categorize the present invention will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description and review of the associated drawings.

" A control according to this invention enhances fuel economy by allowing early upshifts, enhances drivability by minimizing shift busyness, provides consistent shift point determination, and is easily integrated with conventional gearshift point determination and control. 
 A method according to this invention is preferably used in a powertrain of a motor vehicle having an engine, a secondary power source, and a step-change automatic transmission for driving a load. The method, which controls an upshift of the transmission from a current gear to a next gear, includes the steps of establishing first shift points of a demanded engine output and a corresponding vehicle speed, at which the upshift would occur if the engine were the only power source. The length of a first period in which energy is available to the secondary power source is determined. The length of a second period for the current vehicle speed to increase to a target vehicle speed of a first shift point whose corresponding demanded engine output is equal to a combined current demanded output of the engine and secondary power source is determined. The upshift is produced if the length of the first period is equal to or greater than the length of the second period. 
 Stability of the upshift is ensured by the steps of defining second shift points of engine output torque and a corresponding vehicle speed, at which a downshift to the next lower gear from the current gear would occur if the engine were the only power source. A first torque magnitude required to be transmitted by the powertrain to the load for an upshift to occur at the current vehicle speed is determined from the second shift points.

 To achieve the above object, the present invention provides a method for integrating enterprise collaborative operations in the product lifecycle management, wherein a system engineering service platform (SESP) is provided for integrating information systems inside enterprise. In the method, the information systems inside enterprise first finish preparation operations. Next, collaborative operation data generated by the information systems inside enterprise are compiled into a collaborative definition expression (CDE). The CDE is sent to a collaborative virtual machine (CVM) for syntax check, packaging and data encryption and to a SESP kernel (BASE) for interpretation and then to a collaborative operating services component (COSC) for processing. Finally, the processed information is sent to the CVM for check of the CDE.

" To prevent inappropriate or undesirable programs from being viewed, “parental controls” may, for example, act to “filter” the content received from the content provider. Parental controls may block content (e.g., audio and/or video data) based on a variety of content characteristics. For example, parental controls may content, such as video and/or audio programs, encoded with particular ratings information, such as R and X under the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) ratings system. Or, for example, the parental controls may block content encoded with particular content indicators, such as “adult language,” “violence,” and “nudity.” Or, for example, the parental controls may block content based on a particular channel and/or from a particular source. 
 However, various users, for example, viewers of content may share a content player system, such as a computer or a television with a set top box. Each of these viewers may have various different tastes and sensitivities with respect to subject matter of video programs. 
 Parental controls may allow separate filtering criteria to be defined for each viewer (e.g., one for children, one for teenagers, and one for adults). Each viewer's filtering criteria may be activated upon entering an identifier associated with that user and/or with that user's criteria. Thus, for example, if a user enters an identifier associated with criteria for children's programs, only programs suitable for a child are available for viewing. Similarly, if the user enters an identifier associated with criteria defined by that adult, only programs desired by that adult are available for viewing. 
 It is believed, however, that such “multiple-viewer” filtering criteria may be disadvantageous in that only one filtering criteria is active at one time (e.g., the filtering criteria for a child terminates upon entry of an identifier associated with an adult's filtering criteria). Upon termination of the adult's viewing session, the child's identifier must be re-entered to activate the appropriate filtering criteria. Failure to re-activate such filtering may allow the child to access inappropriate content. Furthermore, requiring an identifier to be entered each time a child or other viewer wishes to view video programs may be inconvenient and impractical, for example, if other guardians, such as babysitters, are present. 
 According to an example embodiment of the present invention, controlled access to content is provided. A default profile (e.g., a family profile) is provided which includes at least one filtering criterion (e.g., censorship criterion), the filtering criterion describing at least one of characteristics of content permitted for all of the plurality of users and characteristics of content prohibited for all of the plurality of users. Metadata associated with a selected content and the filtering criterion of the default profile are compared. The metadata includes information related to the selected content. Access to (including, e.g., rendering of) the content is permitted or denied based on the comparison. 
 A content player is also provided. The player may include, for example, a memory device storing a default profile, the default profile including at least one filtering criterion, the filtering criterion of the default profile describing at least one of characteristics of content permitted for all of the plurality of users and characteristics of content prohibited for all of the plurality of users. The player may include a processor configured to compare metadata associated with selected content and the filtering criteria of the default profile, the processor configured to permit or deny rendering of the selected content based on the comparison. 
 In another example embodiment according to the present invention, a method to control access to content is provided which includes selecting content, the selected content having metadata linked thereto via a pointer. The metadata is obtained using the pointer. The metadata and at least one filtering criterion are compared, the filtering criterion describing characteristics of at least one of permitted content or prohibited content. Access to the selected content is permitted or denied based on the comparison. The pointer may be embedded, for example, in a Vertical Blanking Interval (VBI) of a signal of the selected content. The pointer may be a URL, and the metadata may be obtained over the Internet using the URL. 
 In another example embodiment, a content player accessible to a plurality of users is described. The player may include, for example, a memory device storing at least one filtering criterion, the filtering criterion describing characteristics of at least one of permitted content and prohibited content. The player may also include a processor configured to obtain a pointer to metadata associated with selected content, obtain the metadata using the pointer, compare the metadata to the filtering criteria, and to permit or deny rendering of the selected content based on the comparison.

" This invention has been made in view of the above problem, and an object of the invention is to provide an interior illumination lamp in which when this lamp is used at a rear seat, light is prevented from coming into the driver's sight via a room mirror so that the driving operation will not be affected. 
 The above object has been achieved by an interior illumination lamp of the invention provided in that the lamp comprises a body for being fixed to a vehicle body, and a lamp which is angularly movably supported on a support portion mounted on the body, and includes a lens capable of transmitting a beam from a light source therethrough; and the lamp includes a first bezel angularly movably supported on the support portion, and a second bezel which holds the lens, and is mounted on the first bezel; and the second bezel has a reflecting surface for receiving and reflecting transmitted light through the lens, and the reflecting surface is designed to have a low reflectance. 
 In the interior illumination lamp of this construction, the reflecting surface of the second bezel for reflecting transmitted light through the lens when this transmitted light is incident on this reflecting surface is designed to have a low reflectance, and by doing so, the light, reflected by the reflecting surface, is not glaring. Therefore, abeam, coming into the driver's sight, for example, via a room mirror, is not glaring, and therefore will not affect the driving operation. Here, the low-reflectance design can be provided by forming the second bezel using a material of a low reflectance or by coating a material of a low reflectance on the relevant surface of the second bezel forming the reflecting surface. Here, the low-reflectance design means that the reflecting surface is lower in reflectance, for example, than the surface of the first bezel. Therefore, a surface treatment for intentionally lowering the smoothness of the reflecting surface, such for example as a shot blast treatment, can be effected. 
 The invention is also provide in that the second bezel includes a second bezel body holding the lens, and a lid portion attached to the second bezel portion, with the lens held therebetween, and the first bezel is fixed to the second bezel, thereby retaining the lens in a double manner. 
 In the interior illumination lamp of this construction, the second bezel, holding the lens, is fixed to the first bezel, thereby retaining the lens in a double manner, and therefore the lens is positively retained. 
 The invention is further provided in that the lid portion has a light-intercepting portion for intercepting part of a beam which is emitted from the light source to be incident on the lens. 
 In the interior illumination lamp of this construction, the light-intercepting portion, provided at the lid portion, intercepts part of a beam from the light source, and therefore the beam, passing through the lens, is prevented from being irradiated to an unnecessary range. Therefore, the beam is prevented from being irradiated to the driver, for example, via the room mirror, and will not affect the driving operation. 
 In the present invention, there is solved the problem that glaring light from the interior illumination lamp comes into the driver's sight via the room mirror as in the conventional construction, and therefore there is achieved an advantage that the driving operation will not be affected.

" A method of extending signaling capacity between newer stations in a wireless communication system, while maintaining compatibility with “legacy” stations lacking such signaling capacity. To provide BCMCS Indications in a CDMA system that are specific to particular MSs, messages on a Quick Paging (QP) Channel (QPCH) may be extended from binary on/off information states to tristate +1/off/−1 states by imposing binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation on the messages. Variations of the method are adaptable to substantially extend signaling capacity for new stations, while retaining compatibility with legacy stations, for many different signals. 
 In one aspect, the method includes selecting and dividing a legacy signal unit, identifiable by a legacy station as one of two or three states, into subunits, and superimposing one of two inverse phase modulations + and − to each of the subunits to define multiple phase modulation combinations for the subunits. The method continues by identifying a plurality of conditionally distinctive modulation combinations, which are indistinguishable from each other in legacy stations due to legacy processing, but are distinctive to enabled stations. Finally, the method conveys the plurality of conditionally distinctive subunit combinations within messages to convey distinct information states to an enabled station. A version of this method may be configured specifically for receiving stations, and another for transmitting stations. 
 The method may further include identifying, as an information state in a legacy station, an absence of the legacy signal unit at a predetermined time. The method may also include distinguishing the conditionally distinctive subunit modulation combinations, plus a zero amplitude combination, as three distinct states when received in an enabled receiver, while the same three distinct states are identifiable as no more than one state when received in a legacy receiver. The signal units may be legacy quick paging (QP) messages within a quick paging channel (QPCH) frame. In that event, the method may further include time dividing a first legacy QP message directed to a particular mobile station (MS) into subunits, and phasing substantially a first half of the QP message subunits inverse to substantially a second half of the QP message subunits to form the conditionally distinctive modulation combinations. If so, then the method may further include differently modulating a second legacy QP message disposed in a subsequent QP frame of the QPCH and directed to the particular MS, to establish at least one additional conditionally distinctive state that is distinguishable in an enabled receiver but indistinguishable in a legacy receiver. In any event, at least one of the conditionally distinctive states may provide a broadcast and/or multicast service indication if conveyed to an enabled receiver, and provide no identified indication if conveyed to a legacy receiver. 
","1. A method of providing broadcast and multicast service (BCMCS) indication in a CDMA communication system without adding new channels while retaining compatibility between BCMCS indication enabled stations and non-enabled (legacy) stations, the method comprising: 
a) selecting a channel employed in legacy stations to direct signaling messages to individual receiving stations by means of preassigned time division multiplexing (TDM) slots; 
b) determining a TDM slot of the selected channel for messages directed to a particular mobile station (MS) that is intended to receive a BCMCS Indication; and 
c) phase modulating a message transmitted in the determined TDM slot in a manner that will not be distinguished, in a legacy receiving station, as requiring incompatible action."
" It has been discovered that in when the first related art described above is employed, special components must be added to the engine design in order to provide the bypass. The additional components inflate the cost of the engine and consume extra space, which is particularly troublesome in the case of passenger vehicles having little available space. 
 When the second related art described above is employed, the negative pressure inside the compressor increases when the air intake valve is driven in the close direction and lubricating oil leaks into the air intake passage from the compressor. 
 When the fuel injection quantity decreases, the exhaust pressure declines rapidly and the intake pressure declines in a delayed manner after the exhaust pressure declines. Thus, the exhaust pressure sometimes becomes temporarily lower than the intake pressure. If this occurs in an engine provided with an EGR device, there is the possibility that intake air will flow into the exhaust passage through the EGR passage if the EGR passage is left in its normal open state. 
 The present invention was contrived in view of the foregoing. One object of the present invention is to prevent surging in an engine equipped with both a turbocharger and an EGR device while curbing costs by utilizing existing equipment and avoiding undesirable secondary effects. 
 In order to achieve the above identified object and other objects of the present invention, an engine control device that basically comprises an engine operating state detecting section, an EGR quantity control section and a rotational speed control section.

The EGR quantity control section is configured to reduce an EGR quantity delivered by an EGR device to a quantity that is smaller than normal upon detecting the prescribed engine operating state. The rotational speed control section is configured to reduce a rotational speed of a turbine of the turbocharger to a speed that is lower than normal upon detecting the prescribed engine operating state. 
 These and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, which, taken in conjunction with the annexed drawings, discloses preferred embodiments of the present invention.

an engine operating state detecting section configured to detect if an engine with a turbocharger-is operating in a prescribed engine operating state resulting in a fuel injection quantity being reduced by at least a prescribed amount per unit time;

 An exhaust emission control device according to the invention comprises: a diesel particulate filter which is set in an exhaust passage of an engine and catches particulate matters in exhaust gas; an oxidation catalyst set in the exhaust passage so as to be situated on the upper-stream side of the diesel particulate filter; and compulsive regeneration control element which compulsively raises the temperature of the diesel particulate filter in a given interval, the device further comprising filter temperature related value detecting element which detects a parameter related to the temperature of the diesel particulate filter, the compulsive regeneration control element being configured to adjust the interval in accordance with an accumulation history of circumstances in which a value equivalent to a continuous regeneration temperature is exceeded by the parameter related to the temperature of the diesel particulate filter. 
 Thus, the interval for the start of continuous regeneration can be properly adjusted in accordance with the history of the circumstances in which a state for continuous regeneration is realized. Accordingly, the circumstances in which the continuous regeneration state is realized are reflected in the compulsive regeneration interval, so that unnecessary compulsive regeneration and retardation of the compulsive regeneration can be prevented.

 Preferably, the compulsive regeneration control element adds up cases in which the parameter related to the temperature of the diesel particulate filter continues to be not lower than a given temperature for a given time, and the interval is lengthened with the increase of the resulting cumulative value. According to this configuration, the interval can be adjusted with the circumstances for the realization of the continuous regeneration state reflected in it, the fuel-efficiency and exhaust gas performance can be improved. 
 Preferably, the filter temperature related value detecting element detects the temperature of the exhaust gas directly on the upper-stream side of the diesel particulate filter, and the compulsive regeneration control element adjusts the interval in accordance with the exhaust gas temperature and executes the compulsive regeneration control in accordance with the exhaust gas temperature. According to this configuration, the exhaust gas temperature directly on the upper-stream side of the diesel particulate filter is used for the control for the adjustment of the compulsive regeneration interval and the compulsive regeneration control, so that both the control systems are simplified.

" The present invention has an object to provide an antireflection film forming method for optical surface end surface of an optical fiber allowing even a beginner to easily form an antireflection film at a low cost, and an optical fiber manufactured according to this method. 
 Modes of embodying the present invention will be explained. 
 (1) An antireflection film forming method for optical fiber comprises a step of dipping an optical fiber in a coating solution having a film forming material dissolved therein; and a step of forming an antireflection film on the end surface of the optical fiber.

 (4) The antireflection film forming method for optical fiber, wherein the film forming material is a fluorine-containing compound. 
 (5) The antireflection film forming method for optical fiber, wherein the angle of the end surface of the optical fiber to the level of the coating solution is changed, when the optical fiber is pulled up from the coating solution, to adjust the reflection reducing wavelength band of the antireflection film to be formed on the end surface of the optical fiber. 
 (6) The antireflection film forming method for optical fiber, wherein the angle of the end surface of the optical fiber to the level of the coating solution is changed, when the optical fiber is pulled up from the coating solution, to adjust the reflectance of the antireflection film to be formed on the end surface of the optical fiber. 
 (7) An optical fiber having an antireflection film formed on the end surface, wherein the antireflection film is formed by dipping. 
 (8) The optical fiber, wherein the film forming material is a fluorine-containing compound. 
 (9) The optical fiber, wherein the film thickness of the antireflection film is uneven. 
 (10) The optical fiber, wherein the film thickness of the antireflection film is even. 
 According to the present invention, an antireflection film forming method for optical surface end surface of an optical fiber allows even a beginner to easily form an antireflection film at a low cost. An optical fiber manufactured according to this method is provided. 
 The present invention relates to improvements in the optical fiber having an antireflection film formed on the end surface and the antireflection film forming method for optical fiber. 
 The end surface of the optical fiber is dipped in a coating solution having a film forming material dissolved therein, and the optical fiber is then pulled up from the coating solution. The pulling speed in the pulling is changed to control the film thickness or surface shape to a desired one, and the antireflection film is formed. Particularly, the reflection reducing wavelength band or reflectance is adjusted to a desired one. 
 The film forming material is preferably a fluorine-containing compound. 
 When the optical fiber is pulled up, the end surface of the optical fiber is preferably inclined at a prescribed angle to the level of the coating solution to precisely ensure the desired reflection reducing wavelength band (or desired film thickness) and reflectance, thereby forming an antireflection film. 
 It is preferable to form the antireflection film on the end surface of the optical filter by dipping method. Particularly, at least the vicinity of the end surface of the optical fiber is dipped in a solvent having the film forming material dissolved therein, and then pulled up from the coating solution. At that time, the pulling speed is preferably changed to a prescribed value to precisely ensure the desired reflection reducing wavelength band (or desired film thickness) and reflectance, thereby forming an antireflection film. 
 The angular inclination between the level of the coating solution and the end surface of the optical fiber is preferably set to, for example, an angle larger than 0° to an angle of 90°. 
 According to the present invention, since the end surface of the optical fiber can be inclined at a prescribed angle to the level of the coating solution and pulled up at a prescribed speed, an antireflection film having desired thickness and reflectance can be easily formed on the end surface of the optical fiber at a low cost. The present invention further has the effect that the film thickness, reflectance and the like can be precisely controlled.

It is an object of the present invention to enable reverse mounting of the support plate on the rod which connects the front shell and the rear shell to be reliably detected during a leak inspection. It is another object of the present invention to ensure that a supporting function of the support plate is not impaired even when the support plate is reversely mounted.

 a shell body; 
 a stud bolt extending through the shell body; and

controlling said height and said planarity of said integrated circuit die with said clamping mechanism of said molding machine."
" The inventors of the present invention produced plate-shaped elements on an experimental basis and carried out impact and fatigue tests, on the basis of the knowledge according to the above conventional techniques. However, even in the case where the area percentage and shape of carbide is in the range of the above-described knowledge (within the range in which impact and fatigue properties can be improved), some plate-shaped elements exhibited remarkably low impact and fatigue strengths, and it seems that sufficient improvement is not achieved by the above-discussed conventional techniques. 
 It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an improved plate-shaped element of a belt for a belt type continuously variable transmission, which can effectively overcome drawbacks encountered in conventional plate-shaped elements of the similar nature. 
 Another object of the present invention is to provide an plate-shaped element of a belt for a belt type continuously variable transmission, which is provided with such composition and characteristics as to obtain high part strengths (fatigue and impact strengths).

" Furthermore, if the key frames are automatically selected, human input in deciding what should be considered interesting will be absent. An automatically generated video summarisation may be fast, but may miss more subtle interesting moments or, at the other extreme, return too many false alarms. The decision as to what is interesting should ideally be made by a person, and preferably the wearer of the video camera which captured the footage, as their sense of familiarity with the footage brings significant input to the effectiveness of the review. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 5,805,733 (Wang) describes a method and system of summarising scenes in a video sequence by detecting scene changes and then comparing scenes in a moving window to determine their similarity. Similar scenes are consolidated and represented by a representative frame. Multiple representative frames are displayed to the user who can then select which set of consolidated related scenes to view. This method may be difficult to apply to footage obtained from a wearable camera, where there may be no distinct scene changes. 
 It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a method and apparatus for reviewing video, which seeks to alleviate the above mentioned disadvantages. 
","1. A video reviewing method, comprising: 
deriving at least two video segments from unedited video footage; and 
displaying a display window for each of the derived video segments substantially concurrently, wherein a spatial relationship between the display windows indicates a temporal relationship between the video segments."
" The present invention is directed toward devices and methods for use in preparing and eating shellfish, such as crab. In one embodiment, the device can incorporate a handle and a working end. The handle can have a pair of handle members, at least one of which is movable relative to the other between two distinct positions. The working end can similarly have a pair of blades coupled at their proximal ends to a corresponding one of the handle members. The blades can be coupled to each other at a point located distally with respect to the central portion of the blades, and are adapted such that the central portion of the blade is movable laterally. The blades can be operated by manipulating the handle members, moving between an aligned configuration in which the blades are at aligned with each other and a spread configuration in which the central portion of at least one of the blades is spaced apart laterally from the central portion of the other blade. The aligned configuration facilitates insertion of the working end into the shellfish, while the spread configuration punctures the shell with the central portion of the blade. By removing the device from the shellfish while retaining the working end in the spread configuration, the device can make a slit along the length of the shellfish, facilitating removal of the meat therefrom. 
 In one particular embodiment, the device incorporates blades made of substantially rigid material, wherein each blade is assembled from a pair of substantially rigid members pivotally linked to each other at their central region. The blades are also pivotally coupled together at their distal ends, and are fixedly coupled at their proximal ends to the handle members to pivot therewith. When the handle members are pivoted relative to each other, the proximal ends of the blades pivot relative to each other in response. When the proximal portions of the blades rotate outward, the distal portions of the blades pivot in opposing directions to compensate for this movement, so that the distal ends of the blades can remain in a constant longitudinal alignment. 
 In other embodiments, the materials and configuration can vary, while maintaining the spirit of the invention. Versions of the invention can use flexible materials instead of rigid materials, can use more or fewer linkages, and can be bilaterally symmetrical or asymmetrical. One of ordinary skill in the art, having reviewed this entire disclosure, will appreciate these and other variations that can be made to the embodiments shown and described below.

 In one aspect, the present invention is directed to a system for determining downhole conditions that includes a time domain reflectometer operable to generate a transmission signal and receive a reflected signal. A tubular is positioned in a downhole medium and a waveguide, which may comprise a plurality of transmission lines, is operalby contacting the downhole medium and is in communication with the time domain reflectometer. The time domain reflectometer transmits pulses, such as electrical or optical pulses, through the waveguide and receives reflections indicative of spatial changes in the electrical properties of the downhole medium. More specifically, the electromagnetic properties of the waveguide are influenced by the electrical properties of the downhole medium and change in response to changes in the medium. 
 The time domain reflectometer includes a signal generator and a signal receiver. In one embodiment, time domain reflectometer includes a step generator and an oscilloscope. In another embodiment, the time domain reflectometer includes a signal generator and sampler, a datalogger and a data interpreter.

The downhole medium in which the waveguide is positioned may include constituents such as water, gas, sand, gravel, proppants, oil and the like. In operation, once the reflected signal is received by the time domain reflectometer, a profile of the downhole medium may be generated based upon the amplitude and phase of the reflected signal, by comparing the reflected signal to a control waveform or by comparing the reflected signal to the transmitted signal. The electromagnetic profile of the downhole medium is created due to variations in the electromagnetic properties of the downhole medium such as impedance, resistance, inductance or capacitance. 
 In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a method for determining downhole conditions. The method comprises the steps of generating a transmission signal, propagating the transmission signal through a transmission line operably contacting a downhole medium, reflecting the transmission signal in response to an electromagnetic property of the downhole medium, receiving the reflected signal and analyzing the reflected signal to determine at least one downhole condition.

" The present invention discloses a robust, reliable and low-cost metal structure and process enabling electrical wire connections to the interconnecting copper metallization of integrated circuits (IC). The structure comprises a layer of barrier metal that resists copper diffusion, deposited on the non-oxidized copper surface in a thickness such that the barrier layer reduces the diffusion of copper at 250° C. by more than 80% compared with the absence of the barrier metal. The structure further comprises an outermost layer reduces the diffusion of the barrier metal at 250° C. by more than 80% compared with the absence of the bondable metal. Finally, a metal wire is bonded to the outermost layer for metallurgical connection. 
 The barrier metal is selected from a group consisting of nickel, cobalt, chromium, molybdenum, titanium, tungsten, and alloys thereof. The outermost metal layer is selected from a group consisting of gold, platinum, and silver. 
 The present invention is related to high density and high speed ICs with copper interconnecting metallization, especially those having high numbers of metallized inputs/outputs, or “bond pads”. These circuits can be found in many device families such as processors, digital and analog devices, logic devices, high frequency and high power devices, and in both large and small area chip categories. 
 It is an aspect of the present invention to be applicable to bond pad area reduction and thus supports the shrinking of IC chips. Consequently, the invention helps to alleviate the space constraint of continually shrinking applications such as cellular communication, pagers, hard disk drives, laptop computers and medical instrumentation. 
 Another aspect of the invention is to fabricate the bond pad metal caps by the self-defining process of electroless deposition, thus avoiding costly photolithographic and alignment techniques. 
 Another aspect of the invention is to be guided by the metal diffusion coefficients for selecting the appropriate pair of metals and the coordinated layer thicknesses in order to minimize up-diffusion at the elevated bonding temperatures and subsequent bond-inhibiting chemical reactions. 
 Another aspect of the invention is to advance the process and reliability of wafer-level multi-probing by eliminating probe marks and subsequent bonding difficulties. 
 Another object of the invention is to provide design and process concepts which are flexible so that they can be applied to many families of semiconductor products, and are general so that they can be applied to several generations of products. 
 Another object of the invention is to use only designs and processes most commonly employed and accepted in the fabrication of IC devices, thus avoiding the cost of new capital investment and using the installed fabrication equipment base. 
 These objects have been achieved by the teachings of the invention concerning selection criteria and process flows suitable for mass production. The non-oxidized surface of the copper of the bond pad is seeded by a metal such as palladium and covered with a layer of a barrier metal such as nickel. The thickness of this barrier layer has to be such that it prevents excessive copper up-diffusion at the elevated temperatures of the bonding operation. The outermost layer is a bondable metal such as palladium or gold. The layer thickness has to be such that it prevents nickel up-diffusion to the surface, where it would oxidize and impede wire bonding. In mass production, the various metal layers are deposited by electroless plating, thus avoiding the need for expensive photolithographic definition steps. 
 The technical advances represented by the invention, as well as the aspects thereof, will become apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments of the invention, when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the novel features set forth in the appended claims.

The distractor portion of the invention has a distractor head or plug incorporating a keyed shape on its face that mates to a portion of the retractor via a keyway in the distal end of the retractor. This mating portion of the retractor has a profile that matches or is similar to the profile of the distractor head. The distractor head has a rod fastened to it, preferably using machine screw threads that provide a means to apply insertion force to the entire assembly, and removal force to the distractor portion of the assembly. 
 Once the distractor is engaged with the retractor through its keyway, the shape of the retractor keyway does not allow the distractor to slide ahead of the retractor. This enables the distractor to apply insertion force to the entire assembly to enable progression into the incision, followed by insertion of the distal tip of the entire assembly into a portion of the disc space, with most or all of the insertion force applied to the distractor. 
 A slot adjacent to the retractor keyway enables removal of the distractor from the retractor after insertion of the assembly into the operating site, allowing for an increase of exposure in the operating field, and for minute changes in distraction by exchanging the distraction portion of the assembly. After the assembled distractor and retractor are inserted into the operating site, the retractor can be used to maintain distraction at the operating site by employing its distal end profile (described above). 
 The retractor has a thinned or blade shaped proximal end to allow for flexibility of its proximal portion, enabling further progression of retraction and permitting increased access to the operating field. In addition, the retractor has convex curved surfaces that interface with a significant amount of retracted soft tissue during progression of the retraction process, which contributes towards retractor safety. The portion of the retractor tool described above as ‘thinned or blade shaped’, is formed at the opened end of the above-described slot by abruptly tapering to a uniform thickness which extends uniformly to the proximal edge of the surgical tool.
","1. A distractor with integrated retractor for use in spinal surgery, comprising: 
a distractor tool comprised of a shaft fastened to a keyed distractor head, said distractor head having a profile that is tapered and rounded, said profile having a maximum width approximately equivalent to the distraction height required for a given surgical distraction spacing specification; 
a retractor having a keyway at its distal end that integrates with said keyed distractor head, said retractor distal end having a profile shaped similar to the profile of said keyed distractor head; 
whereby surgical distraction of vertebra and retraction of adjacent soft tissue can be maintained by said retractor after initial distraction has been accomplished by said distractor integrated with said retractor, thus allowing subsequent removal of said distractor tool from the retractor keyway and the operating site after initial distraction has been accomplished, thereby expeditiously obtaining retraction and a comparative increase in access to the operating site when distraction and retraction are coincident surgical requirements; 
and these coincident surgical requirements can be facilitated by combining the insertion of said distractor tool with said retractor by integrating said distractor tool with said retractor through said keyed distractor head and retractor keyway, additionally this integration permits removal and replacement of said distractor tool, enabling incremental distraction changes by successive exchanges of the distractor."

" Tokkai Hei 7-332149 issued by the Japan Patent Office in 1995 discloses a method in which the temperature of the gas inside a cylinder is calculated, assuming adiabatic compression of the gas in the cylinder, from the pressure inside the cylinder with respect to the crank angle, and the temperature of the gas in the cylinder at the crank angle corresponding to the start of calculation. If the temperature of the gas inside the cylinder reaches 1200K or above, then it is considered that knocking will occur. Here, K indicates the absolute temperature. 
 However, since this prior art technology determines the pressure inside the combustion chamber by means of a pressure sensor, it is necessary to adapt the calculation to changes in the operational state of the engine, and hence the number of adaptation steps required is very large.

" However, the disclosed method has a possibility of deterioration in accuracy of the time measurement because it utilizes the charging/discharging of the capacitor. Another problem is that the microcomputer is started up to count the number of times at which the capacitor has been charged and discharged, a consumption current increases during the operation of the microcomputer. 
 Further, the disclosed method has just means for measuring the turned-off time of the ignition switch. In other words, because the disclosed method cannot measure a time during which the engine has operated, it is impossible to calculate the lifetime up to now which is required to predict aging and other secular changes of engine auxiliaries, etc. 
 Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to measure a turned-off time of an ignition switch with a low consumption current and high accuracy at a level adapted for a demand from the controlling side, as well as a turned-on time of the ignition switch. Another object of the present invention is to measure an accumulative turned-on time of the ignition switch.

" The present invention solves many of the problems associated with the sealing of stirrer or mixing shafts traversing bores in the walls of large mixing vessels and is particularly suited to mixing involving hazardous (combustible) materials. The concept involves the provision of shaft sealing glands that do not contact the walls of the mixing vessel yet promote redirection of material tending to escape from the mixing vessel back into the mixing vessel. Material is urged back into the mixing vessel, preferably by a series of raised, spaced, radially distributed, angled wiper strips attached to the outside surface of each mixing gland which cooperate with the corresponding direction of shaft rotation during mixing to urge material moved toward the gland gaps by the mixing action back toward the interior of the mixing vessel. The sealing glands are mounted on stirrer shafts with associated housings as gland assemblies which rotate with the shafts being sealed during mixing, but are attached to a mechanized drive system which retracts the gland assemblies for cleaning and maintenance between mixing batches and repositions the glands for the next mixing operation. 
 In a preferred embodiment, the mixing glands are brass with attached raised wiper strips made of plastic and the gland housings are stainless steel. Both the housings and glands are preferably made in two halves which bolt together using external bolts and which allow the parts to dovetail circumferentially and therefore operate as a unitary structure when rotated or telescoped along the shaft during deployment and retraction. Rotation relative to the shaft is prevented by the provision of drive clamps fixed around the mixing shaft. The drive clamps allow the gland assemblies to move along the stirrer shafts but prevent relative rotation between them. See FIG. 6. 
 A drive system is provided to move gland/housing combinations (gland assemblies) between a deployed position with the gland located within the wall bore and a retracted position in which the gland assembly is withdrawn outside of the mixer wall. Such a system is described with respect to a pair of mixing shafts such are commonly used in combination in mixers of the class. A mixer typically includes a pair of spaced, generally parallel bladed stirring shafts designed to rotate in opposite directions. As indicated, the shafts are provided with sealing glands with housings that form gland assemblies. The housings of the gland assemblies are provided with circumferential grooves that accommodate a common pusher plate mounted therebetween. The pusher plate is, in turn, operated by a double-acting fluid operated cylinder mounted thereon which moves the pusher plate relative to the mixer vessel wall and with it the gland assemblies which telescope along the stirrer shafts, which are generally perpendicular to the wall or end plate of the mixer, thereby causing the sealing glands to deploy and retract, as desired. 
 In a preferred embodiment, the rod end of the fluid cylinder is attached as by a clevis joint to a mounting plate that is fixed to the wall of the vessel in a manner such that extension of the cylinder rod causes the cylinder and the pusher plate, which carries with it the gland assemblies, to move away from the vessel wall thereby retracting the gland for cleaning. Conversely, when the cylinder rod is collapsed or retracted back into the cylinder, this causes the pusher plate and with it the gland assemblies to move back toward the wall and into position for mixing. In one embodiment, the cylinder is an air cylinder, however, hydraulic units would work as well.

In one aspect of the invention, the compositions, hereinafter termed “proteons,” are comprised of misfolded proteins. Also provided are compositions and methods for the isolation and manipulation of proteon nucleation centers (PNCs), upon which the proteons of the present invention form. The PNCs are comprised of metallic nanoclusters. 
 Proteons can be visualized by microscopy of biological materials, for example fluids such as blood samples of mammals and homogenates of vegetable matter. As proteons are comprised of misfolded proteins, detection of proteons and identification of the proteins can be used to diagnose and measure progression of disease states. For example, proteons isolated and purified from blood and blood plasma lack detectable nucleic acids, but contain two major polypeptide populations with high homology to the alpha chain of hemoglobin. 
 Accordingly, methods for the amplification and detection of misfolded protein in a biological sample are provided. Additionally, methods for the clearance of misfolded protein from a sample of biological material are provided. The method can be manipulated by subjecting the sample to heat or pressure, or by carrying out various numbers of seeding steps. Methods for amplification include heat and pressure treatment of a sample. Likewise, subjecting a biological sample to or treating it with metal clusters increases the concentration of proteons. 
 While the present invention is not bound to any particular mode of action, it is believed that proteons are formed by a mechanism involving the reversible polymerization and aggregation of proteins, particularly misfolded proteins, on a nucleation center. For convenience, the nucleation centers are referred to as “proteon nucleation centers” or “PNCs.”
 The PNCs of the invention are unexpectedly pro-apoptotic when added to cultured animal cells. Accordingly, pro-apoptotic compositions and methods for their production are also provided herein.

" The present invention is directed to circuits, such as adders and comparators. The circuit (for fN or f′N) employs approximately 1.5N gates, but with significantly less depth than prior techniques. More particularly, the depth of the circuit is approximately logr N, where r={square root}{square root over (3)}=approximately 1.732. Hence, the depth of the circuit is approximately 1.26 log2 N, compared to approximately 1.44 log2 N achieved by the Gashkov et al. circuits or N-1 achieved in the circuit of FIG. 1. 
 A process is provided for implementing a logic circuit for performing logical operations based on a function

 where N is selected as the number of inputs to the logic circuit. 





 In a first embodiment, successive two-row portions of the logic circuit are recursively defined based on a pre-selected pattern of first and second gate types. A top portion has N inputs and ]N/3[ outputs, with inputs to each successive portion being connected to outputs of the prior portion and each portion having one-third the number of outputs. Upon reaching a number of variables less than 5, a bottom level of the circuit is selected based on the number of remaining inputs. The depth of the circuit is computed from the ternary value of N-1 containing D digits, such that the depth is 2D-1 where the first digit of the ternary value is “1” and the depth is 2D where the first digit of the ternary value is “2”. 
 In a second embodiment, smaller depth can be achieved in some cases by designing a circuit for N-1 inputs and transforming the seven most-significant input portion of the circuit to an eight-input portion. Combining this method with that of the first embodiment, the depth can be reduced by 1 in some cases, namely, where the ternary value of N is between 100000 . . . and 101010 . . . and between 200000 . . . and 201010 . . .

Odd-positioned inputs in the N′-N most significant inputs are set to a first binary value and even-positioned inputs in the N′-N most significant inputs are set to a second binary value. Unnecessary gates are then removed from the design. 
 Based on the function, the first gate type is set as either logical OR or logical AND gates and the second gate type is set as the other of either logical OR or AND gates. 
 In other embodiments, the process of the invention is carried out by a computer operating under control of a computer readable program on a computer useable medium for addressing data to design logic circuits for comparators, adders and similar operation.

" In order to establish angular contact with respect to a roller having a limited width, it is necessary to reduce the pressure angle (contact angle) denoted by the reference character P in FIG. 7, with the result that sufficient recovery couple cannot be obtained sometimes. Further, in order to control the contact angle, it is necessary to relatively increase the difference in radius of curvature between the roller guide surface and the generatrix for the outer peripheral surface of the roller. Doing so will result in an increase in contact surface pressure, which would sometimes cause premature wear of the contact region. Either case leads to a lowering in performance, sometimes causing a shudder to occur in a vehicle having the joint mounted thereon. 
 The present invention is intended to eliminate such problems. That is, the object of the invention is to provide a tripod type constant velocity joint given a construction such that a recovery couple is produced to correct the inclination of the rolling direction of the roller while reducing the surface pressure without using angular contact provided by a Gothic arch-shaped roller guide surface and such that the NVH characteristic is maintained for a long time. 
 The invention provides a tripod type constant velocity joint comprising an outer joint member formed with track grooves at three equispaced positions on the circumference of the inner peripheral surface, an inner joint member formed with radially projecting leg shafts, or trunnions, at three equispaced positions on the circumference, rollers carried each on the respective trunnions rotatably and oscillably, with the rollers rolling in the track grooves axially of the outer joint member, the tripod type constant velocity joint being characterized in that the radius of curvature of the generatrix for the outer peripheral surface of the roller is smaller than the radius of the outer diameter surface (radius of the cross section of the roller) and in that where r1 and r2 are the minimum and maximum values, respectively, of the radius of curvature of the generatrix for the outer peripheral surface of the roller within the range where solid contact is effected by elastic deformation of the contact section between the roller and the roller guide surface under a predetermined torque load with respect to the radius of curvature of the roller guide surface, the radius of curvature r of the generatrix is set in the range r1≦r≦r2. 
 This setting makes it possible to provide a contact angle over the entire width of the roller and to increase the recovery couple during torque load. Further, the solid contact occurring in the high load region greatly reduces the contact surface pressure to reduce wear of the contact section. In the above setting, the radius of curvature r of the generatrix for the outer peripheral surface of the roller has its allowable range defined to be up to a value slightly smaller than the radius of curvature R of the roller guide surface. Since the roller is of torus shape, an inclination of the roller in the rolling direction results in the same state as the setting r>R, that is, the area of the roller adjacent its widthwise middle separates from the roller guide surface and instead the areas of the roller adjacent its widthwise opposite ends contact the roller guide surface. 
 To give a concrete example of predetermined torque load, it is not more than ½ of a joint break torque. By the joint break torque is meant, specifically, a torque corresponding to a static torsion breakage torque found from the minimum diameter of the shaft. 
 The widthwise opposite ends of the outer peripheral surface of the roller may be provided with roundings having a radius of curvature smaller than the radius of curvature of the generatrix in the direction away from the roller guide groove, thereby making it possible to avoid edge load at a widthwise end of the roller. 
 According to the invention, it is possible to generate a large recovery couple to correct the inclination of the rolling direction of the roller without using angular contact provided by a Gothic arch-shaped roller guide surface and since the contact surface pressure can be reduced, wear is reduced, so that the NVH characteristic can be maintained for a long time.

A piston is reciprocally disposed within the cylinder bore and defines a combustion chamber with the engine body and the cylinder bore. A crankshaft is coupled to the piston so as to rotate with movement of the piston. At least one valve is movable between a closed position and at least a first open position.

A portion of the decompression member being configured to place the valve generally at the first open position when the decompression member is placed at the first position and releases the valve from the first open position when the decompression member moves to the second position. A regulating member is carried by the camshaft. The regulating member is movable between a regulating position and a non-regulating position wherein the regulating member regulates movement of the decompression member when the regulating member is at its regulating position. The regulating member releases the decompression member from the first position when the regulating member is at its non-regulating position. A bias member is arranged to urge the regulating member toward its regulating position. The regulating member is configured so as to move toward its non-regulating position against the urging force of the bias member when a rotational speed of the camshaft exceeds a predefined speed. 
 In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a four stroke engine comprises an engine body defining a cylinder bore. A piston is reciprocally disposed within the cylinder bore and defines a combustion chamber with the engine body and the cylinder bore. A crankshaft is rotatable with a movement of the piston. At least one valve is movable between at least a first open position and a closed position. The combustion chamber is open when the valve is placed at the first open position. A camshaft is driven by the crankshaft. The camshaft has a cam portion to actuate the valve. A first member of a decompression mechanism is movable within a first guide aperture of the camshaft. The first member has a first end and a second end. A second member of the decompression mechanism is movable within a second guide aperture. A bias member is disposed at one end of the second member to urge the second member to engage the first member. The second member is arranged to keep the first member in a decompression position where the first end of the first member projects out of the camshaft to move the valve to the first open position when a centrifugal force affecting the second member does not overcome an urging force of the bias member. The second member is further arranged to release the first member from the decompression position when the centrifugal force overcomes the urging force of the bias member. A center of gravity of the first member is positioned closer to the second end than the first end such that the first member withdraws into the first guide aperture when the centrifugal force affects the first member. 
 The integration of the members of the decompression mechanism into the camshaft reduces the effective size of the decompression mechanism, thereby allowing it to fit into small spaces within the engine. Additionally, those portions of the decompression mechanism that must project beyond the surface of the camshaft, once the engine has started and is running, can be located at positions along the camshaft where they do not interfere with the operation of the cam surfaces of the crankshaft and the corresponding surfaces of the followers (e.g., tappets).

" In accordance with the present invention, it was discovered that adhesion of metal catalyst particles to a ceramic support can be increased by doping the interface between the ceramic support and the metal catalyst particles with one or more adhesive agents that include early transition metals in their elemental or suboxide form. This increase in adhesion suppresses sintering of the particles and results in prolonged useful catalyst lifetimes when the catalysts are used in a non-oxidizing atmosphere. In addition, it was discovered that the same adhesive agent can be used to increase the adhesion between the ceramic support and metal monoliths regardless of the oxidizing or non-oxidizing nature of the atmosphere in which the catalyst is used. 
 The present invention is directed to catalytic systems that include an oxide ceramic support that has alumina as a principal ingredient. The ceramic support is doped with an adhesive agent so that the surface of the support includes the adhesive agent. The adhesive agent is designed to form an open-shell electronic structure at the interface between the catalyst particles and the support. It is believed that this open-shell electronic structure at the interface increases the adhesion between the particles and the support and reduces sintering. 
 The adhesive agents that promote an open-shell electronic structure at the particle-support interface include titanium, zirconium, scandium, hafnium, yttrium and lanthanum. The adhesive agents are present as a reduced metal or suboxide and not as an oxide. Metal catalysts, such as nickel, palladium and platinum, all have nearly closed shell electronic structures and alumina is a highly ionic material. In accordance with the present invention, this closed shell/ionic interface is modified with adhesive agents to be more open-shell/covalent in nature to increase adhesion. Titanium, zirconium, scandium, hafnium, yttrium, and lanthanum are adhesive agents that all have an open-shell electronic structure. 
 The present invention may be used to prolong useful catalyst lifetime of any heterogeneous catalyst systems where a metal-ceramic interface exists. The invention involves doping the support or otherwise introducing relatively small amounts of one or more adhesive agents so that they are present at the particle-support interface. The adhesive agent(s) does not completely cover the support surface. The adhesive agent(s) is typically present as a ¼ to 4 monolayer at the support surface. This level of doping provides a sufficient open-shell electronic structure to increase bonding of the metal particles to the support without otherwise deleteriously affected the catalytic properties of the metal catalyst particles. The catalyst is intended for use in a non-oxidizing atmosphere in order to avoid completely oxidizing the reduced metal or suboxide form of the adhesive agent. 
 The present invention also includes modifying the interface between the ceramic support and metal monolith with the same adhesive agents that are used to treat the catalyst/ceramic support interface. This results in an increase in the adhesion between the two heterogenous materials. Such catalyst systems are suitable for use in both oxidizing and non-oxidizing atmospheres because the adhesive agents are substantially shielded by the ceramic support. 
 The above discussed and many other features and attendant advantages of the present invention will become better understood by reference to the detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A second blocking measure B is independently determined at the respective ones of the plurality of nodes such that application of a logical combination of the first blocking measure A and the second blocking measure B to the anomalous traffic stops the anomalous traffic. 
 In other embodiments of the present invention, the second blocking measure B is determined by applying a logical combination of A and the second blocking measure B given by (A & !B) to the anomalous traffic where the logical combination (A & !B) is a less restrictive blocking measure than the logical combination (A & B). The logical combination (A & !B) is enforced if the logical combination (A & !B) stops the anomalous traffic.

" In the above-mentioned patent literature 1, there is a description that with the formation of the protective metal film, it is possible to suppress the phenomenon that the developer reaches the ITO film.

" The present invention overcomes the above-described and other problems and disadvantages in the prior art by providing a musical device adapted for removable and cooperative use with a drum or similar percussion instrument such that striking or otherwise sounding the percussion instrument also sounds the musical device. In a preferred embodiment, the musical device comprises a ring and a plurality of jingles. The ring is adapted to support the jingles and to removably lay upon the drum. The ring is lightweight and otherwise constructed in such a manner so as not to interfere with playing the drum or with the quality of sound produced by the drum. 
 The plurality of jingles are coupled with and supported by the ring and are movable so as to affect the desired sound in response to a striking of the drum. The jingles are spaced apart and movably coupled with the ring, though no jingles are present on a reserved portion of the ring to allow for substantially unrestricted access to the drumhead by the drummer. In a preferred embodiment of the jingles, each jingle includes a rivet; an upper disk; and a lower disk. The rivet is adapted to retain the upper and lower disks in physical association with the ring while allowing for an amount or degree of movement necessary to produce the desired sound. The upper and lower disks cooperate by striking one another to produce the desired sound of the jingle. 
 In exemplary use and operation, a ring of appropriate dimensions and desired sound quality is placed upon a drumhead such that the associated jingles project upwardly. The ring or the rivets may rest directly upon the drumhead. The reserved portion of the ring which is free of jingles is oriented toward the drummer to allow for substantially unrestricted access to the drumhead and unimpeded use of the drummer's stick or hand in striking the drumhead. Thereafter, striking the drumhead elicits vibratory or other movement that is transferred to the jingles, thereby causing them to sound. 
 Thus, it will be appreciated that the musical device of the present invention provides a number of substantial advantages over the tambourines of the prior art, including, for example, allowing for removably associating jingles with an existing drum or similar percussion instrument such that striking or otherwise sounding the percussion instrument also sounds the jingles. In a conventional tambourine the jingles are integrated into the tambourine's shallow cylindraceous body, making them permanently part of an independent and distinct musical instrument, i.e., the tambourine. This connectedness or integration with the tambourine can be a disadvantage where only the jingles are desired but the entire tambourine must be owned, transported, played, and maintained in order to have the jingles. Furthermore, in order to sound the jingles the tambourine must be played; making it difficult for a drummer to sound the jingles in conjunction with one or more other drums. The present invention advantageously separates the jingles from the tambourine to provide a musical device that can be easily and removably associated with any drum desirable. This is accomplished by associating the jingles with the lightweight ring that is laid upon any size drumhead, rather than permanently integrating them into the cylindraceous body of the drum as is done in the prior art. 
 These and other important features of the present invention are more fully described in the section titled DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT, below. 
","1. A musical device comprising: 
a ring; and 
a plurality of jingles coupled with the ring, 
wherein the ring is removably associatable with a drumhead such that striking the drumhead causes the plurality of jingles to sound."

" It has now been found that a method and apparatus for measuring ultralow water permeation through a sample object, such as a composite film that includes a thin polymer layer, can be effectively created by utilizing a radioactive gas, such as tritiated water vapor (HTO) or carbon14monoxide (14CO). By suitably mounting the sample object so as to provide controlled access to opposite surfaces of the barrier and by supplying HTO or 14CO to its upstream surface, the permeating radioactive gas exiting downstream can be collected in a carefully controlled, dry carrier gas stream and monitored in a manner which can precisely determine even extremely low permeation rates through the sample. The method affords highly accurate measurement of ultralow permeation rates by uniformly controlling the humidity or other concentration at the upstream surface and by using a controlled, very low flow of dry carrier gas, preferably one having a matching molecular weight, downstream thereof in a chamber of only minimal size. Such a slowly flowing stream will collect all the radioactive permeated gas and carry it to a radiation monitor in an ionization chamber of minimal size where the permeation rate is then quickly and accurately calculated.

mounting a sample through which permeation is to be measured so as to provide controlled access to an upstream surface of the sample in a first chamber and to a downstream surface thereof in a second chamber, wherein said second downstream chamber has a volume of not greater than about 10 cm3, 
supplying a radioactive gas from a source to be in contact with the upstream surface of the sample in the first chamber, 
collecting radioactive gas permeating from the downstream surface of the sample by circulating a very slow flow of dry carrier gas at a rate of not greater than about 1.5 liter per hour through the second chamber to provide a radioactive stream, 
flowing said radioactive stream from said second chamber to an entrance to an ionic chamber not greater than about 2 liters in volume containing a beta-particle radiation monitor, 
continuously monitoring said stream for beta particle radioactivity and generating signals, and 
receiving signals from said radiation monitor in conversion means and converting the signals to calculate the permeation rate through the sample at that moment, whereby the sensitivity of the method allows measurement of permeation of radioactive gaseous compounds through samples that have barrier properties which permit permeation at rates of only 0.0001 to about 0.00001 gm/sq.m/day or less."
" A power control command requiring a power increase, or UP power control command, or UP TPC (where TPC stands for Transmit Power Control), is not applied if the transmit power would be increased by more than Power13 Raise13 Limit dB over the last DL13 Power13 Averaging13 Window13 Size TPC commands. 
 Power13 Raise13 Limit and DL13 Power13 Averaging13 Window13 Size are parameters of the algorithm and are configured in the Node B by the RNC, using the NBAP (Node B Application Part) protocol at the cell setup (message ‘cell setup request’ sent by the RNC to the Node B).

P(k)=P(k-1)+PTPC(k)+Pbal(k), 

 where PTPC(k) is the k:th power adjustment due to the inner loop power control, and Pbal(k) [dB] is a correction according to the downlink power control procedure for balancing radio link powers towards a common reference power.

" To address the foregoing problem, a groove or “moat” may be formed in the top surface of the conductive element in a T-PAC module. When the film is applied, if there is any excess film material, for example due to the height of the conductive element, the excess material will be taken up by the groove so that it will not spill over the sides of the conductive element and interfere with the subsequent application of the resin mold. 
 According to one aspect of the invention, a semiconductor module may comprise a circuit substrate; a semiconductor device and an additional component, each having respective upper and lower electrodes, the lower electrodes being disposed in electrical contact with the circuit substrate; a conductive element being electrically connected to the circuit substrate and having a web portion that bridges over and contacts the respective upper electrodes of both said semiconductor device and the additional component; the web portion having an upward-facing web surface, and a recess being formed in the web surface.

" What is needed in the art is a single, integrated device which overcomes the limitations of currently available technology. The device allows for easy connection to currently available patch panels which use both an input network fiber and an output network fiber. The device incorporates a low cost optical circulator to allow for receiving and transmitting network optical signals on a single fiber optic cable. Additionally, the device allows the use of a single frequency transmitter and receiver, thus eliminating the need for both a DFB laser and a VCSEL. 
 The present invention uses a low cost optical circulator packaged in a compact bi-directional communications module configured to couple to standard communications network components, such as a communications panel and/or a patch panel. The module includes a module casing within which is disposed an optical circulator. The optical circulator has a first port through which optical data is transmitted, a second port through which optical data is received, and a third port through which optical data is both transmitted and received. 
 Optically communicating with the first port and second port of the circulator is a duplex connector. This connector has a first connector that is adapted to optically communicate with the first port and a second connector that is adapted to optically communicate with the second port. The module further includes a means for optically communicating the third port with the patch panel to enable bi-directional communication of optical data. 
 This means for optically communicating can include a receptacle adapted to receive a pigtail lead. In another configuration, the means for optically communicating includes a pigtail lead integrally formed with the communications module. In still another configuration, the means for optically communicating may include a pigtail that is removably attached or coupled to the module casing. By so doing, the module provides structures that enable bi-directional communication along a single optical fiber rather than typical bi-directional communication using two separate optical fibers. 
 The optical circulator may have numerous configuration such as those described herein. The optical circulator may includes optical wedges, Faraday rotators, beam splitters, wave plates, beam shifters, or other optical components to change a polarization of the optical signal and hence direct a transmit signal input into a first port of the circulator to a third port of the circulator and direct a receive signal input into the third port to a second port of the circulator.

" In a first embodiment of the invention there is provided a draft inducer having an impeller which resides within a housing. The impeller includes one or more backward curved blades and a central impeller structure. The impeller is coupled to a motor which is preferably a DC motor. The DC motor resides at the center of the impeller and is housed within the impeller structure. The impeller includes one or more openings for letting a fluid flow between the blades of the impeller. 
 The draft inducer includes at least a fluid inlet for a first fluid and a fluid outlet for a combination of a first fluid and a second fluid. In some embodiments, the draft inducer has multiple fluid inlets. The multiple fluid inlets meet at a mixing chamber within the housing of the draft inducer. The mixing allows the second fluid to flow into the chamber and to mix with the first fluid. In one embodiment, the first fluid is the hot gas of the hot water heater and the second fluid is the ambient air. The second fluid is drawn into the mixing chamber as the result of the impeller spinning. The inlet to the mixing chamber may be a slit in a plate which allows hot gas (first fluid) from a hot water heater to pass into the mixing chamber. The pressure that builds up on the inlet side of the plate from the heated hot gas forces the hot gas through the slit and into the lower pressured mixing chamber. The impeller also assists in drawing the hot gas into the mixing chamber. The slit is sized so that the amount of ambient air brought into the mixing chamber by the spinning impeller is much greater than that of the hot gas, thus causing the temperature of the mixture to be much less than that of the hot gas. 
 The size of the hot gas inlet and the ambient air inlet are adjusted along with the power of the motor driving the impeller to produce compliant exhaust emissions and exhaust temperatures for a given length of exhaust pipe. 
 The draft inducer is sized so that it may reside between the cold water inlet pipe and the hot water outlet pipe on the top of a hot water heater. Further, the impeller is sized such that it is mounted horizontally and spins about a vertical axis. 
 In a further embodiment, a predetermined flow rate is maintained in a flow path between the hot water heater or other source to be ventilated and the outside environment. The flow path starts at the outlet of the source to be ventilated, pass through the draft inducer to an exhaust pipe which terminates with the outside environment. The draft inducer in this embodiment has a voltage powered motor. First a voltage is provided to the motor which causes the motor and impeller blades of the draft inducer to rotate. This causes the exhaust from the source to be ventilated to be drawn into the draft inducer and passed through to flow path to the outside environment. The revolutions of the motor are determined, preferably the RPMs. The RPM signal is provided to a processor which compares the RPM value to values in a look-up table. If the measured RPM value does not substantially match a value in the look-up table, the voltage provided to the motor is adjusted. The process is continued until the measured RPM value is equal to a value within the look-up table. The look-up table is composed of RPM values that are associated with different voltage/impedance pairs. For example, for a given PWM waveform (voltage) and a given impedance (length of ventilation piping) a single RPM value is provided in the look-up-table. In the embodiment as disclosed the motor is preferably a DC motor and further the impeller has backward curved blades. 
 If the measured RPM value exceeds a predetermined threshold, an alarm will be activated indicating that there is an occlusion in the flow path. If the measured RPM value is below a predetermined threshold, another alarm is activated to indicate that there is a leak in the flow path. Both an occlusion and a leak can be determined using the methodology disclosed with using either a pressure sensor or a vacuum switch. 
 The methodology described may be performed in conjunction with a processor, and certain steps may be performed by computer code which is on a computer readable medium that is provided to the processor.

At least one side air inlet is defined in at least one of a plurality of sides of the casing of the first fan unit and a plurality of sides of the casing of the second fan unit. 
 The air inlet amount and the air outlet amount of the second fan unit are increased when the first fan unit operates normally. In a case that the impeller of the first fan unit operates abnormally and thus results in a low air-blowing efficiency, the impeller of the second fan unit compensates the shortage of air inlet amount resulting in abnormal operation of the impeller of the first fan unit by introducing air into the heat-dissipating module via the side air inlet. The air density distribution is uniform, and the wind noise during operation is lowered.

The cleaned drill cuttings preferably include not more than 1 wt. % oil. Exemplary solvents are C2-4 natural gas liquids, ethane, butane, propane, and combinations thereof. 
 The present process may include the steps of grinding the drilling fluid to reduce the particle size of the drill cuttings, contacting the drilling fluid with a solvent at optimum extraction conditions, separating the used solvent mixture from the drill cuttings; repeating the extraction and separation, adjusting the conditions of the drill cuttings to ambient, and recycling the solvent.

" If demands from the market for even higher functionality are to be satisfied by applying prior art, the following problems are raised. 
 Problem 1 
 Concerning the market demand for an even higher number of ports, for example in order to implement a single adapter provided with four ports, if one has recourse to the first method practiced until now, one is obviously in a trend of increasing component counts. For this reason, the design difficulty due to the increase in wiring density of the adapter boards in question, and the cost of the boards, will soar, and there is also the apprehension that the probability of failure, considering in addition the adapter board as a whole, will get worse. Again, it may be thought that there will also be a harmful effect on data transfer performance, as the latency of requests via the PCI bridge is lengthened. 
 Problem 2 
 On the one hand, if one has recourse to the second method practiced until now, due to the logic circuit core with completely independent plural fibre channel functions, there occurs a waste of processing capacity in each core. Generally, input output processing is ordinarily not carried out to maintain peak performance, and there exist time periods with no processing performed and time periods demanding peak performance. For this reason, considered over a long time, the protocol processor is only processing approximately 50% of the time (much idle time). However, with a protocol processor performance at a 50% level of the peak performance, since a long time is required when input output processing requires peak performance, it is normally designed to satisfy peak time processing requirements. That having been said, even though on average a performance at a 50% level of peak times is sufficient, the protocol processor will maintain the performance for peak times occurring temporarily. 
 For example, let us consider the case of two completely independent logic cores, for two fibre channel functions integrated into one LSI circuit. The total processing capacity of these two protocol processors will be twice that of the peak capacity of one fibre channel function of the aforesaid configuration. In other words, because of their complete independence, it is not possible to perform a load distribution of the mutual processing on the mutual protocol processors, and they will on average have excess processing capacity. 
 Problem 3 
 As mentioned in the Background of the Invention, a higher-speed technology for a single fibre channel interface (10GFC) is in the process of becoming standardized, and if one considers a simple multiplication of the transfer rate in order to implement this, a protocol processor processing capacity five times higher or more than when using 2 Gbps becomes necessary. Neither with the first method nor the second method mentioned in the Background of the Invention is it possible to make an implementation only by simply equipping the device with multiple components, and it is necessary to introduce or develop processors et cetera capable of high-speed processing. Consequently, the ability to migrate from 2-Gbps to 10-Gbps processing is also a problem that should be considered. 
 It is an object of the invention of the present application to provide a high-flexibility input output control device which, in order to solve the problems mentioned above, supports a plurality of 2-Gbps fibre channels and which also takes into account the transition to 10-Gbps fibre channels.

" It has now been established through this invention that when Mannich base is incorporated in combination with an amine based antioxidant into the gasoline fuel containing cracked components obtained from various secondary processing units (viz. FCC, VB and Coker, etc.), the oxidation of fuel, sediment formation, corrosion inhibition and water uptake tendencies are improved appreciably in comparison to when any of the aforesaid components is added alone to the fuel. 
 For example, if amine based antioxidant was used alone then potential gum level was reduced from base value of 132 g/m3-258 g/m3 to around 32 g/m3-38 g/m3 in gasoline fuel at 20 mg/lit to 50 mg/lit as per ASTM D-873/IP: 183 (Modified). While at the same dosages level and at higher levels of Mannich base alone, the potential gum level could not be brought down to the desired level of less than 50 g/m3. However, when using a combination of Mannich base and an amine-based antioxidant, the potential gum level in the gasoline fuel was reduced to approximately 28 g/m3 as compared to 258 g/m3 potential gum value of the base gasoline fuel.

" The invention provides a method to form an integrated circuit transistor having a reduced gate height. The invention provides a methodology of forming a laminated structure having a substrate, a gate conductor above the substrate, and at least one sacrificial layer above the gate conductor. The invention patterns the laminated structure into at least one gate stack extending from the substrate by forming spacers adjacent the gate stack and forms doping regions of the substrate not protected by the spacers to form the source and drain regions adjacent the gate stack. The invention then removes the spacers and the sacrificial layer. 
 The height of the gate conductor is smaller than a gate height associated with the spacing of the source and drain regions created by the spacers. The size of the spacers is controlled by the combined height of the gate conductor and the sacrificial layer, such that the spacers provide larger spacing for the combined height when compared to the height of the gate conductor alone. The larger spacing positions the source and drain regions further from the gate conductor when compared to source and drain regions formed with spacers formed only to the height of the gate conductor. 
 The sacrificial layer above the gate conductor is formed by forming a sacrificial oxide layer above the gate conductor and forming additional sacrificial layers above the oxide layer. The sacrificial oxide layer protects the gate conductor. The laminated structure has a silicon layer below the gate conductor and further dopes source/drain electrodes and the gate conductor together in a self-aligned implantation after the patterning process. 
 The combined height of the gate conductor and the sacrificial layer prevents the impurity from reaching the silicon layer and without the sacrificial layer the doping process would implant an impurity through the gate conductor and gate dielectric layer to the silicon layer. The laminated structure has a silicon layer below the gate conductor. The source/drain electrodes and the gate conductor are doped together in a self-aligned implantation after the patterning process. The invention also provides a second doping process of doping halo regions below the gate conductor in a self-aligned implantation with an impurity of an opposite polarity to that used in the first doping process. The combined height of the gate conductor and the sacrificial layer prevents impurities from reaching the silicon layer, and without the sacrificial layer, the doping processes would implant impurities through the gate conductor and gate dielectric layer to the silicon layer. 
 The invention further provides a method of epitaxially growing raised source and drain regions above the substrate layer adjacent the temporary spacers, such that the temporary spacers separate the raised source and drain regions from the gate stack. Then the invention grows an additional dielectric layer on the raised source and drain regions, removes the temporary spacers without removing the sacrificial material, performs a halo implant in the raised source and drain regions and in exposed regions of the silicon layer and forms a permanent spacer adjacent the gate stack. The permanent spacer is thinner than the temporary spacer. Next, the invention implants impurities into the raised source and drain regions and exposed regions of the silicon, forms a final spacer filling the exposed regions of the silicon between the permanent spacer and the raised source and drain regions. This is followed by implanting additional impurities into the raised source and drain regions and exposed regions of the silicon, annealing to activate all impurities, etching back the additional dielectric layer on the raised source and drain regions, and saliciding both the gate conductor and the raised source and drain regions. 
 The artificial increase in gate height achieved with the sacrificial layer at the top of the gate stack allows the formation of larger disposable spacers. The invention uses a two-step spacer formation process for spacer width modulation (sacrificial and permanent spacers). With the larger spacers, the invention also avoids the dopant encroachment and silicide bridging problems that can occur when the reduced gate height limits and decreases the achievable size of the spacers.
","1. A method of forming an integrated circuit transistor having a reduced gate height, said method comprising: 
forming a laminated structure having a substrate, a gate conductor above said substrate, and at least one sacrificial layer above said gate conductor; 
patterning said laminated structure into at least one gate stack extending from said substrate; 
forming spacers adjacent said gate stack;

" The invention relates to gelled cosmetic compositions, and specifically, oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions, which comprises at least one sugar-based emulsion stabilizer and at least one non-siloxane based polyamide resin. The prepared emulsions, while they are not themselves clear, are substantially transparent after application to the skin. Use of the polyamide resin as a gelling agent per se is not new, however, its incorporation into the color compositions of the present invention containing, for example, alkylglucosides with about 8 to 16 carbon atoms, as an emulsion stabilizer is surprising. The cosmetic emulsions of the present invention also comprise a color component present in an amount greater than about 2.0 percent by weight of the composition. The ability to gel a color cosmetic emulsion with the polyamide resin as the primary gelling agent is particularly challenging because the polyamide is very polar and emulsions containing large quantities of polyamide tend to be tacky and are difficult to stabilize in the presence of colorants. 
 The present invention also includes methods of making the emulsion systems of the present invention which can include multiple emulsion systems. The emulsion products are especially transparent and transfer resistant when they are applied to the skin and allowed to dry. The compositions containing these emulsions have an enhanced brightness and clarity with respect to their color on the skin after application thereon due to the transparent film that adheres to the skin without being tacky. The emulsion systems of the present invention dry faster than other polyamide containing systems, and are long wearing even after the water evaporates. In addition, gels and sticks made with the emulsion system of the present invention are less brittle, experience a substantial lack of syneresis, and have a creamier texture because the three-dimensional structure formed by the polyamide resin is interrupted partially by the water phase.

" However, when the crystallized glass for observation windows of stoves, disclosed in Patent Documents 1 and 2, is used as the material for observation windows that are exposed to higher temperature than stoves, such as garbage incinerators, metal fusing furnaces, glass fusing furnaces and heat-treating furnaces, then it could not almost block out visible light and heat rays. Therefore, if operators try to observe the inside condition of the furnaces through the observation windows without protectors such as light-shielding glasses or light-shielding plates, then they may be dazzled and hot. Another problem with them is that the heat in the furnaces goes out through the observation windows. Therefore, the thermal efficiency of the furnaces is poor. 
 If protectors such as light-shielding glasses or light-shielding plates are used when the inside condition of the furnaces is observed through the observation windows, then they may be effective for dazzling prevention but are not effective for heat insulation. In addition, using the light-shielding plates worsens the operators' working efficiency. These are still other problems with the observation windows of the type.

In addition, it has been recognized that it would be advantageous to develop a blood pump with a hybrid permanent magnet and electromagnetic set with permanent magnets to manage greater forces (axial or thrust) and an electromagnet to manage lesser forces (radial). In addition, it has been recognized that it would be advantageous to develop a blood pump with optimum configuration permanent and electromagnetic bearings to enable the best blood pump flow performance. In addition, it has been recognized that it would be advantageous to develop a blood pump with proper start up direction of rotation.

However, if desired, bowing can also be eliminated by careful design of the shells cross section and variation of the individual layer thicknesses. 
 In some embodiments, the printhead is a plurality of printhead modules positioned end to end along the beam.

" An improved process for growing high-quality silicon dioxide films or layers on a silicon surface in a nitrous oxide-containing ambiance is disclosed. The silicon surface is subjected to a gaseous mixture of nitrous oxide (N2O) and ozone (O3). The presence of O3 in the oxidizing ambiance greatly enhances the oxidation rate compared to an ambiance in which N2O is the only oxidizing agent. It is hypothesized that the presence of O3 promotes growth of a dielectric layer that is predominantly silicon dioxide, although small numbers of nitrogen atoms are incorporated in the silicon dioxide matrix. Thus, a silicon oxynitride layer (i.e., a silicon dioxide layer having a high nitrogen content) having a high degree of impermeability to the oxidant species is prevented from forming. The presence of O3 in the oxidizing ambiance does not impair oxide reliability, as is the case when silicon is oxidized with N2O in the presence of a strong, fluorine-containing oxidizing agent such as NF3 or SF6. 
","1. A process for forming a dielectric film on a surface of a layer containing silicon process comprising: 
introducing into a chamber a gaseous mixture including nitrous oxide having a partial pressure, ozone having a partial pressure, at least one compound containing a halogen and steam, the partial pressure of the ozone being at least one tenth the partial pressure of the nitrous oxide in the gaseous mixture, the gaseous mixture being substantially free of fluorine-containing gases; and 
forming the dielectric film by contacting at least a portion of the surface of the layer containing silicon with the gaseous mixture including nitrous oxide, ozone, at least one compound containing a halogen being substantially free of fluorine-containing gases, and steam."
" An extensible kernel-mode audio processing architecture is described herein. 
 According to one aspect, an audio processing architecture is implemented using multiple modules that together form a module graph. The module graph is implemented in kernel-mode, reducing latency and jitter when handling audio data by avoiding transfers of the audio data to user-mode applications for processing. 
 According to another aspect, the audio processing architecture is a MIDI data processing architecture. 
 According to another aspect, an interface is described for implementation on each of the multiple modules in a module graph. The interface provides a relatively quick and low-overhead interface for kernel-mode modules to communicate audio data to one another. The interface includes a ConnectOutput interface via which the next module in the graph (that is, the module that audio data should be output to) can be identified to the module, and a DisconnectOutput interface via which the previously-set next module can be cleared (e.g., to a default value, such as an allocator module). The interface also includes a PutMessage interface which is called to pass audio packets to the next module in the graph, and a SetState interface which is called to set the state of the module (e.g., run, stop, or a transitional pause or acquire state). 
 According to another aspect, the audio processing architecture is readily extensible. The audio processing architecture is implemented as multiple kernel-mode modules connected together in a module graph by a graph builder. The graph builder can readily change the module graph, adding new modules, removing modules, or altering connections as necessary, all while the graph is running. 
 According to another aspect, the audio processing architecture includes an allocator that allocates memory for data packets that are passed among modules in a kernel-mode module graph. The allocated memory can be on a data packet basis, or alternatively larger buffers may be allocated to accommodate larger portions of audio data. 
","1. A computer-readable medium having stored thereon a data structure, the data structure comprising: 
a presentation time portion indicating when audio data is to be rendered;

a flag portion indicating to a kernel-mode transform filter whether the data portion includes the pointer to the chain of additional data structures."
" The present invention discloses a method of efficiently manufacturing fuel cells having coated bipolar plates. The present invention contemplates the laser welding together of individual metallic plates already having a conductive coating thereon to form the bipolar plates that are used in a fuel cell. Such a method has heretofore not been considered due to the organic component of the coating. Specifically, metallic bipolar plates are typically made from stainless steel which when exposed to carbon from an organic coating in a welding process can cause the exposed regions to be sensitized and less corrosion resistant. The primary component of stainless steel which imparts corrosion resistance is Chromium. If stainless steel is exposed to carbonaceous materials during high temperature processing (e.g., near or above it's melting point), carbon will combine with Chromium in the metal. This reduces the amount of Chromium available for use in creating passive oxide surface films that afford the metal it's corrosion resistant properties. The reduction in alloy corrosion resistance results in evolution of ferrous and ferric ions which contaminate the polymer membrane and reduce its' mechanical durability as well as its' hydrogen ion transport efficiency. Thus, the sensitization of the plates is undesirable as the useful life of the plates is reduced. Therefore, the typical manufacturing process is to clean the surfaces of the plates to remove any organic contaminates prior to welding, thus preventing the coating of the plates prior to welding. The removal of all organic contaminates prior to welding thereby prevents sensitizing the plates and avoids the associated reduction in corrosion resistance. The inventors of the present invention, however, have discovered that the laser welding of the coated plates together does not result in sensitization of the plates to a magnitude sufficient to cause an undesirable level of corrosion resistance. This result is achieved regardless of the presence of the organic coating in the region of the plates being welded and regardless of the ablating of the organic coating by the laser beam.

" Applicant has carefully analyzed the advantages and failings of flexible alerting and has recognized inventively that while the called party can specify the flexible alerting arrangement, there is no equivalent of flexible alerting for callers. A flexible alerting arrangement for callers can be useful for cases in which a caller has special information, e.g., an unlisted number of one of the destinations, for a flexible alerting list that is not provided by the called party. 
 In accordance with Applicant's invention, a calling party provides to a switch serving that calling party a list of called numbers corresponding to a special number assigned to the caller. When the caller dials this special number all telephone numbers on that list are alerted. The alerting takes place in one of two arrangements: in accordance with a first arrangement all the numbers are alerted simultaneously and the call is completed to the first station that answers. In accordance with another feature of Applicant's invention, the various stations on the list are alerted sequentially either following a pre-assigned number of rings or with an arrangement wherein a connection is set up to successive telephone numbers on that list in response to receipt of a signal such as a flash or a special dialed code. Advantageously, the caller can control the alerting, either in parallel or sequentially, of a group of telephone numbers without requiring that a called party has established such a list. For example, a special customer demanding immediate and continual access to the owner of a business may establish a list similar to the one described for flexible alerting in order to control access to the owner of the business. 
 As an example of the use of this facility, a business owner may have three numbers on a flexible alerting list the number of the office, the number of the cell phone, and the number of his home. In the case of a special client, the special client may have his own enhanced alerting list which would include those three numbers plus the number of the business owner's vacation house so that the special client can reach the owner even at the owner's vacation house (which may have an unlisted number). 
 In accordance with one feature of this invention, one of the numbers may be that of a pager; this is especially useful if the called party wishes to restrict use of the pager for only special purposes. For this case, the system must provide both the number of the paging service and the called party's identification number, as well as the means for dialing the paging service and then, after an appropriate pause, providing the identification number.
","1. A method of alerting a called telephone station comprising the steps of: 
defining, for a calling customer, an enhanced alerting list and a telephone number for calling for said enhanced alerting list; 
responsive to said customer dialing said telephone number, alerting the telephones of the telephone numbers on said enhanced alerting list."
" The distance measuring device according to the present invention has the advantage over the related art that a device located outside the vehicle is controlled via transmitters of the distance measuring device which otherwise is used for measuring a distance between the vehicle and obstacles. A device for emitting the control signals may be used, which is already designed for emitting signals based on its function as a distance sensor. A separate transmitter, which would have to be provided in the case of a car radio antenna, for example, as it is usually designed only for receiving signals, may thus be omitted. In addition, the usefulness of a distance measuring device in the vehicle is enhanced because it is usable for additional applications. In addition, it is not necessary to carry in the vehicle a separate standalone remote control device having its own power supply. 
 It is particularly advantageous that the measuring signal and the control signal differ in frequency and/or signal shape. This prevents accidental triggering of a device outside the vehicle by a measuring signal. It is particularly advantageous that the transmitter is designed as an ultrasound transmitter because it makes simple analysis of ultrasound signals for both distance measurement and data transmission of a control intent possible. 
 It is furthermore advantageous that the transmitter is designed both for receiving a measuring signal and for receiving a communication signal emitted by the device located outside the vehicle, which is controlled by the distance measuring device. This makes it possible to conduct a dialog between the device located outside the vehicle and the user, i.e., a control device in the vehicle. 
 It is furthermore advantageous to activate all transmitters on the vehicle if a control signal is to be emitted. In this way, a user does not have to orient the vehicle in a defined position with respect to the device to be controlled. 
 For example, when driving through a gate to be opened automatically, the driver may approach the gate either in reverse or in forward driving mode in order to open the gate by an activation via the distance measuring device according to the present invention. 
 It is further advantageous to provide a display unit for displaying a function of the distance measuring device according to the present invention as a control function of a device located outside the vehicle. A user is thus informed when the distance measuring device is operating in the control mode, which may make it impossible for a distance warning to take place.
","1. A distance measuring device in a vehicle, comprising: 
at least one transmitter for emitting a measuring signal; and 
a controller for controlling the transmitter in such a way that the transmitter emits a control signal for controlling a device situated outside the vehicle."
" An airbag deployment control system is set forth that obtains current information about a vehicle occupant from an imaging sensor, and employs such occupant information to condition deployment of an airbag to protect the occupant. For definition, the precise position of the imaging sensor is deemed to be at a received-image point that is representative of the region through which the imaging sensor receives an image of the occupant. The imaging sensor is positioned within the vehicle between concentric spheres that are defined by maximum and minimum radii from a Focus Of View (FOV) point, so that the sensor is with a specified range of distances from the FOV point. The FOV point is located with reference to a standard model of an occupant that is placed in a typical position in the vehicle seat, centered in its fore-aft range of motion, for which the airbag provides protection. The allowable radii of the received-image point from the FOV point may be appropriately limited, as described below in more detail. 
 Further constraints may be placed upon the imaging sensor position. As one example, the imaging sensor may be positioned such that the received-image point is located within 200 mm of an aft- most vertical plane of an airbag suppression zone, or within 200 mm of the windshield-headliner intersection when that intersection is aft of the airbag suppression zone. Additionally, the imaging sensor may be laterally restricted from any vertical-fore/aft plane that traverses the occupant's seat. The imaging sensor may be limited with respect to a headliner of the vehicle, and may be required to have an unobstructed view of much or all of a top of a window for the occupant. A properly positioned imaging sensor will accord with a combination of one or more of these constraints. 
","1. A method of controlling deployment of an airbag in a vehicle, the method comprising: 
a) classifying an occupant of the vehicle as one of a plurality of possible classifications with regard to airbag deployment vulnerability, based upon information received by a processing facility obtained from a solitary imaging sensor for the airbag; 
b) defining a suppression zone for the airbag having a longitudinal extent between suppression zone maximum and minimum longitudinal references of the vehicle; 
c) determining whether an occupant is intruding upon the suppression zone based upon information about the occupant received exclusively from the solitary imaging sensor; 
d) conditioning deployment of the airbag at least in part on the determination in step (c) as to whether the occupant is intruding upon the suppression zone for the airbag; 
e) mounting the solitary imaging sensor such that an image entrance plane center (IEPC) point is disposed: 
i) within 200 mm of an airbag suppression zone rear plane that defines a minimum longitudinal (rearmost) extent of the suppression zone, or within 200 mm of a windshield header of the vehicle if the windshield header is rearward of the airbag suppression zone rear plane; and 
ii) 500 mm to 700 mm distant from a focus of view (FOV) point that is defined for the vehicle with respect to an expected typical position of the occupant."
" In one exemplary embodiment, an automated medication preparation is provided and typically involves the preparation and dispensing of drug products, whether they are in a bag, a syringe or via some other type of administration vehicle. For example, in one embodiment the automated medication preparation is incorporated into a hood within an I.V. room and is constructed to be accessed in the course of manual preparation of an I.V. product, in order to ensure that the correct drug, dose, expiration and lot of a product are chosen. 
 In another embodiment, the system includes an automated device for delivering a prescribed unit dose of medication to the syringe by delivering the medication through the uncapped barrel. This is preferably done in a just-in-time for use manner. One exemplary automated device for delivering a prescribed unit dose of medication to the syringe is in the form of an automated device having a fluid delivery device that is movable in at least one direction. The fluid delivery device is adapted to perform the following operations: (1) receiving and discharging diluent from a diluent supply in a prescribed amount to reconstitute the medication in a drug vial; and (2) aspirating and later discharging reconstituted medication from the drug vial into the syringe. 
 A label containing medication information (medication identifying indicia) is disposed about an outer surface, e.g., a circumference, of the drug vial. The automated system includes a vision system for detecting and processing the medication information that is found on the label, the vision system is capable of reading a barcode that is formed on the label and includes an optical device for producing a rollout image of the label as the drug vial is rotated on a turntable, as well as an optical recognition system (software) for reading a particular coordinate location of the rollout image and for detecting and recognizing characters that at least represent an expiration date and lot number information of the drug vial as well as bar coded information. A controller is provided and is in communication with the vision system and is configured to compare medication information read from the bar code with inputted medication information. The controller also compares the expiration date with a present date and the lot number with a drug recall list. The controller will signal and influence the downstream processing of the automated system when at least one of the following event occurs: (a) the read medication information is different from the inputted medication information; (b) the expiration date is earlier than or within a prescribed number of days from the present date; or (c) the lot number is on the recall list. If one or more of these events occurs than the controller prevents the unit dose from being automatically delivered from the drug vial to the syringe. 
 The optical device includes a rollout camera that produces the rollout image (and is capable of producing a rollout photograph, if desired) and more specifically, the drug vial is disposed on a rotatable turntable that is in operative communication with the controller so as to calculate an optimal speed of the turntable, based on a number of inputted parameters, including a circumference of the drug vial, as well as an optimal focusing distance of the camera to ensure that a high quality rollout image is captured. From the rollout image and the implementation of a coordinate mapping system, discrete target zones of the label can be read and processed to detect and process any drug identifying indicia formed in these areas. 
 Further aspects and features of the exemplary automated system disclosed herein can be appreciated from the appended Figures and accompanying written description.

" It is an object of the present invention to provide a transgenic plant containing a gene in which a DNA encoding a protein that binds to a stress responsive element and regulates the transcription of genes located downstream of the element is ligated downstream of a stress responsive promoter, the transgenic plant having improved tolerance to environmental stresses (such as dehydration, low temperature and salt) and being free from dwarfing. 
 Toward the solution of the above problem, the present inventors have cloned a novel transcription factor gene that regulates the expression of genes involved in the acquisition of dehydration, low temperature or salt stress tolerance, and introduced into a plant this novel gene ligated downstream of a stress responsive promoter. As a result, the inventors have succeeded in creating a plant which has remarkably improved tolerance to dehydration, low temperature or salt and which is free from dwarfing. Thus, the present invention has been achieved. 
 The present invention relates to a transgenic plant containing a gene in which a DNA encoding the following protein (a) or (b) is ligated downstream of a stress responsive promoter: 

 (a) a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 8 or SEQ ID NO: 10; 
 (b) a protein which consists of the amino acid sequence having deletion, substitution or addition of at least one amino acid in the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 8 or SEQ ID NO: 10 and which regulates the transcription of genes located downstream of a stress responsive element.

" The present invention aims at providing a mobile communications system capable of distributing a process load of a network under an environment in which a number of mobile terminals possibly start handovers. 
 The mobile communications system having a plurality of base stations forming the respective cells adjacent to one another, the plurality of base stations include a transmission unit for transmitting a signal for use in detecting a cell of a mobile terminal at each of a plurality of frequencies. Among the plurality of base stations, the plurality of frequencies have different boundaries of a range reached by the signal. 
 A handover occurs when a mobile terminal passes the boundary between cells. In the system according to the present invention, the range reached by the signal for use in detecting a cell in the mobile terminal substantially corresponds to a cell, and the boundary depends on the frequency. Therefore, although a number of mobile terminals simultaneously travel, the triggers of handovers can be distributed. A “boundary” refers to a concept including an area of overlapping portions of reached ranges. “Different boundaries” refer to overlapping portions displaced to each other. 
 In another aspect of the mobile communications system according to the present invention having a plurality of base stations forming the respective cells adjacent to one another, the plurality of base stations include a transmission unit for transmitting a pilot signal at each of the plurality of frequencies. The transmission unit transmits the pilot signal with different transmission power for the plurality of frequencies. 
 A pilot signal is used by a mobile terminal detecting a cell. The transmission power of the pilot signal depends on the frequency. That is, the radius of a cell depends on the frequency. Therefore, the boundary of a cell depends on the frequency, thereby distributing the trigger of a handover. 
 In the mobile communications system according to a further aspect of the present invention having a first base station and a second base station forming adjacent cells, the first and second base stations include a transmission unit for transmitting a pilot signal at the respective frequencies. The transmission unit of the first base station includes a first transmission antenna for transmitting a pilot signal at a first frequency, and a second transmission antenna, provided in a position closer to the second base station than the first transmission antenna, for transmitting a pilot signal at a second frequency. The transmission unit of the second base station includes a third transmission antenna for transmitting a pilot signal at the first frequency, and a fourth transmission antenna, provided in the position farther from the first base station than the third transmission antenna, for transmitting a pilot signal at the second frequency. 
 With the above-mentioned configuration, since the positions of transmission antennas for transmitting a pilot signal depend on the frequency, the boundary position of a cell can be different for each frequency. Thus, as with the above-mentioned aspects of the present invention, the triggers of handovers can be distributed. 
 Any of the above-mentioned mobile communications systems can further includes: management device for managing a base station accommodating each mobile terminal and the frequency used by each mobile terminal for each of the plurality of mobile terminals in communications; and arrangement device for distributing and assigning the plurality of frequencies to the plurality of mobile terminals. With these devices, the frequencies assigned to a plurality of mobile terminals are distributed, and therefore, the effect of distributing the triggers of handovers can be more conspicuous. 
 According to the present invention, the trigger of the handover is distributed. For example, by a plurality of mobile terminals in communications loaded onto a streetcar, vehicle, bus, etc., the handover processes are simultaneously performed if the mobile terminals concentrate on the vicinity of the boundary of a cell at the same time. According to the present invention, the handover timing is distributed, and the concentration (temporary increase of interference in radio circuits) of the process load of the device managing the handover process can be suppressed. 
","1. A mobile communications system having a plurality of base stations forming respective cells adjacent to one another, the plurality of base stations comprising 
a transmission unit transmitting a signal for use in detecting a cell in a mobile terminal at each of a plurality of frequencies, wherein 
among the plurality of base stations, the plurality of frequencies have different boundaries of a range reached by the signal."
" This invention covers multi-functional “sharps” containers which provide (i) safe transportation of the container and a large number (bulk quantity) of unused PNAs therein, (ii) the safe sequential dispensing of the unused PNAs from the container and (iii) the safe sequential feeding or insertion of used PNAs into the container for safe storage therein; the invention facilitating the ultimate safe disposal of the used PNAs. 
 The present invention provides a safe, space efficient sharps container for providing the aforesaid functions. The invention provides a container which is especially useful for an individual such as a diabetic who may require several daily doses of medication, which doses are required throughout the day (frequently at meal time) and thus may occur at the users residence as well as at other locations such as the user's place of work, at a restaurant, in an automobile or aircraft, etc. The container which on the one hand can contain “bulk” quantities of unused PNAs and provide safe storage for similar quantities of used PNAs, on the other hand, can be relatively compact and sized to fit within a woman's purse or equivalent. 
 In broad terms the present invention provides a container comprising an open-topped receptacle, a cover member, and a manually movable means which may be rotated from a “closed” position to an “open” position. In the open position the manually movable means may receive a used pen needle assembly. Then manual rotation of the movable means to the closed position facilitates the discharge of the used pen needle assembly into the receptacle. The receptacle is sized to hold a plurality of used pen needle assemblies (with or without the outer shields). The receptacle is a cup-like vessel which, although of a size to hold a large number of used pen needle assemblies, may at the same time be “small” and/or “thin” enough to be conveniently portable for travel with the user. The receptacle includes internal means for segregating unused PNAs from used PNAs; such internal means may be a fixed partition or may be a movable dividing tray means. 
 The cover member is sized to fully cover the open-topped receptacle and has a top surface. 
 The manually movable means, in one embodiment, is a rotatable hatch means. The rotatable hatch means is adapted to be mounted in an opening in the top of the cover for rotation between a closed position and an open position. The hatch means includes a top portion, a bottom portion, and a pair of axially spaced-apart side portions which collectively define a cup-like receiving means for only a single PNA when the hatch means is in the open position. Other means for disposing of or discharging used PNAs into the receptacle are also shown. 
 The receptacle also includes an exit opening sized to facilitate sequential withdrawal therethrough of unused PNAs. Several alternatives are shown for storing the PNAs and the sequential dispensing of same through an exit opening in the receptacle. 
 The use of the container by the user is easy. For example, when using the embodiment comprising the above described hatch means, the hatch means is manually rotated to the open position, the used pen needle assembly is placed or dropped into the hatch means, and then the hatch means is manually rotated to the closed position. When the hatch means is closed, then the used pen needle assembly falls into the receptacle. Again, the used PNAs will be stored (hygienically separated from the unused PNAs) in either a space defined in part by a fixed partition or by a movable dividing tray means.

 Further, as a result of the digital measurement apparatus recording the digital signature calculated for the measured data using the private key together with the measured data in a recording medium and as a result of the digital measurement apparatus storing therein a public-key certificate externally produced for the public key which is a companion to the private key, it is not necessary to make wide open to the public the public key of the particular measurement apparatus, but it is only necessary that the public key which is a companion to the private key used for producing the public-key certificate is made wide open to the public. 
 Further, as a result of the digital measurement apparatus having a sequence number, which indicates the order (sequence) in which the measured data is obtained, and recording the sequence number together with the measured data, it is possible to prevent the order (sequence) of the measured data from being confused. 
 Further, as a result of the digital measurement apparatus having at least one external authentication code, updating of the key generating algorithm, the pair of the public key and the private key and the sequence number may be enabled when external authentication corresponding to the external authentication code is established. Thereby, it is possible to maintain the credibility of the signed measured data produced by the digital measurement apparatus for a long period of time. 
 Further, an image measurement apparatus, according to the present invention has a characteristic quantity of an image as a portion of appurtenant information of an image-data format, calculates a digital signature from the image appurtenant information using a private key of the apparatus, and additionally stores the calculated digital signature in the image-data format as image appurtenant information. Thus, as a result of the digital signature being embedded in the image obtained through the image measurement apparatus, it is possible to verify whether or not the image was altered. However, when the digital signature is stored in the digital image, the digital image itself may change due to storing the digital signature. Further, it is not possible to add image appurtenant information later. In order to avoid such a situation, it is made clear which image appurtenant information is used for calculating the digital signature. Thereby, it is possible to change and/or add comments to portions of the appurtenant information, which portions are not useful for improving the credibility of the image, and, therefore, were not used for calculating the digital signature. 
 Other objects and further features of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

" In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the invention to provide a setup that enables strict management of licenses, without any incorrect use of license-requiring data if a communications failure should occur, in a configuration in which an image forming device acquires and uses license-requiring data from a server device. 
 To achieve the above and other objects, there is provided an image forming system including a server device and an image forming device communicably connected to the server device. The server device includes a data storage device and a data transmission unit. The data storage device stores license-requiring data. The license-requiring data is such data that necessitates a license when the image forming device downloads the data from the data storage device. The data transmission unit transmits the license-requiring data. The image forming device includes a reception unit, an image forming portion, a confirmation unit, and an inhibiting unit. The reception unit receives the license-requiring data transmitted from the data transmission unit. The image forming portion forms an image using the license-requiring data received at the reception unit. The confirmation unit confirms a communications state between the server device and the image forming device. The inhibiting unit inhibits use of the license-requiring data by the image forming portion for printing, if the confirmation unit has confirmed that the communication state between the server device and the image forming device has failed. 
 Since this configuration enables the image forming device to acquire the license-requiring data from the server device, the amount of data in the image forming device can be efficiently restrained without necessitating the storage all of the license-requiring data that is likely to be used beforehand. Since printing using the license-requiring data is inhibited if the communications state between the server device and the image forming device has failed, on the other hand, this enables strict management of the license, without allowing any incorrect use of the license-requiring data.

" An object of the present invention is to provide a hearing aid, which can be switched automatically with reduced manufacturing expenditure and increased compactness as well as prolonged service life. 
 This object is achieved according to the invention by a hearing aid having a first hearing aid function, a second hearing aid function and a switching device for automatically switching from the first hearing aid function into the second hearing aid function, the switching device having at least one magnetic field-controlled ferrite component that exhibits a change in impedance that is used as a basis for the automatic switching. 
 The invention is based on the recognition that the change in the permeability of a ferrite component as a function of an applied magnetic field can be utilized for the automatic switching of a hearing aid. The continuous change in permeability as a function of the strength of the applied magnetic field brings about a change in the impedance or inductance in a suitable ferrite component and thus can be used to trigger switching. 
 The first hearing aid function preferably is a microphone operating mode, and the second hearing aid function a telephone coil operating mode. As a result, when making a telephone call, it is possible to switch automatically from the microphone operating mode into the telephone coil operating mode when a telephone receiver with a permanent magnet is placed against the ear. The first hearing aid function, however, may be the switched-on state, and the second hearing aid function may be the switched-off state of the hearing aid. In this case, the hearing aid can, as explained above, be switched on and off by insertion into the storage box, for example. 
 The magnetic-field-controlled ferrite component can be implemented as an SMD ferrite. As a result, the component that is usually used in the high frequency range is used in the present case as a magnetic field sensor. 
 The magnetic-field-controlled ferrite component alternately can be implemented as a coil with a ferrite core. In this case, the switching device preferably has an LC oscillator circuit, the inductance of which is formed by the coil, in order to detect a change in inductance of the coil with the ferrite core. 
 In a preferred embodiment, the switching device has a bridge circuit for detecting the change in impedance. In this case, the bridge circuit can either be dependent on frequency or independent of frequency. In the case of the frequency-dependent bridge circuit, it is possible, for example, to use two SMD ferrites as bridge elements in order to increase the sensitivity. 
 The switching device preferably is equipped with a peak detector with which the change in impedance or inductance can be detected by reference to the maximum values of an alternating voltage signal. As a result, the proximity of a permanent magnet to the magnet-field-controlled component in the hearing aid can easily be determined. 
 The invention thus provides the following advantages: 



 in comparison to a miniature reed contact (6 mm×1.5 mm) the magnetic field sensor can be very small in design, specifically 2 mm×1 mm, for example, 
 the ferrite operates without wear because it has no moving contacts, 
 the sensor can be manufactured relatively cheaply, 
 a ferrite sensor operates virtually without delay, 
 the additional components which are necessary with a ferrite sensor system can easily be implemented in the signal processing IC of a hearing aid.

" The above-mentioned shortcomings, disadvantages and problems are addressed by the present invention, which will be understood by reading and studying the following specification. 
 A system is presented that includes a set of Application Program Interfaces (APIs) for a number of software modules and components for resource limited environments. One example of a resource limited environment is the embedded system, which comprises a variety of consumer devices and specialized industrial controllers, along with hand-held, or palm-size personal computers. 
 One aspect of the system is that the combination of components and modules included in an operating system for resource limited environments is customizable and flexible. This allows an embedded system designer -to include only those components and modules that are necessary for a particular environment. As a result, scarce memory is not consumed by unneeded components, allowing more memory to be devoted to applications and other modules and components that are needed in the embedded system. 
 Another aspect of the system is that APIs are provided that meet the unique input and output needs of the typical embedded system. For example, many embedded systems do not provided a keyboard or mouse for input. The system provides APIs to components and modules that provide alternative mechanisms of providing input. These alternative mechanisms include APIs to handwriting recognition engines that “read” strokes on a touch sensitive screen, and APIs to voice input components that allow a user to issue spoken commands to the system. Further, the system provides APIs to components that output audible speech for those environments where a display monitor is impractical. 
 Another aspect of the system is that the handling of “out of memory” conditions is customizable by an embedded system designer. This is important to systems with limited resources, because out of memory conditions are more likely to occur. 
 A further aspect of the system is that an API to a position and navigation component is provided. This is useful for embedded system environments that are mobile, such as automobiles, trucks, and boats. 
 The APIs summarized above, and various other APIs, will be described in detail in the next section and in the attached appendices. 
 The present invention describes systems, clients, servers, methods, and computer-readable media of varying scope. In addition to the aspects and advantages of the present invention described in this summary, further aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent by reference to the drawings and by reading the detailed description that follows.

" The present invention has been made in view of the aforementioned problem, and it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a hydraulic control device for an automatic transmission, which prevents hydraulic vibration of line pressure from affecting an oil pressure switch for detecting oil pressure of engagement elements.

Therefore, since the engagement element pressure of which hydraulic vibration is reduced is supplied to the engagement elements, oil pressure including great hydraulic vibration is not applied to the oil pressure switch provided in the oil supply path of the engagement element pressure, and failure resulting from deterioration of the durability of the oil pressure switch is not caused.

" In view of the foregoing problems, it is an object of the present invention to produce an automatic transmission control apparatus that is capable of detecting a failure of hydraulic pressure, which is applied to frictional elements, on both sides of engagement and disengagement. 
 According to the present invention, an automatic transmission control apparatus controls a gear position by operating engagement and disengagement of multiple frictional elements. The automatic transmission control apparatus includes a hydraulic pressure detecting means and a failure determining means. The hydraulic pressure detecting means detects hydraulic pressure applied to at least one of the frictional elements.

" Conventional real-time computer discussion or chat systems allow users at multiple separate user computers to communicate with each other substantially simultaneously in real-time. For example, each user is free to enter text messages into the discussion system. A central computer system receives the messages or turns and broadcasts them to each of the participating user computers. The text messages are displayed on a display screen associated with each user computer as a common sequence and set of messages, thereby allowing all users to communicate with each other simultaneously. 
 Many conventional chat systems include a general topic or title for a chat session or “room,” but the general topic is typically very broad and the discussion that actually occurs is often unrelated to the broad topic. Even for discussions that stay within the general topic, the particular discussion is often controlled by one or two active participants or several unrelated discussions can occur at the same time. As a consequence, chat sessions in many conventional chat systems can range from chaotic to non-topical and can be unsatisfying for many participants. 
 To overcome some of these disadvantages, some chat systems include moderators or hosts as discussion participants who have added authority or control to guide chat sessions. A disadvantage of chat session hosts is that every chat session would require a separate person to moderate it. With the immense numbers of chat systems that are operating simultaneously, hosted chat sessions are not practicable for widespread use. 
 The present invention is an application of a real-time computer discussion system having a central computer system with which each of multiple participant computers are in communication, such that messages are transmitted among the participant computers as substantially real-time messages of a discussion between the participants. In one implementation, the invention includes a text discussion script data structure that is stored on a computer-readable medium in association with a real-time computer discussion. The text discussion script data structure is specified by an author to guide a real-time, multi-user, text discussion or “chat.” In one implementation, the text discussion script data structure is specified by markup language tags that, together, form a markup language tag schema. 
 The text discussion script includes one or more successive scenes having roles for each of one or more discussion participants. For each scene and role, the author provides instructions and background information that guide the discussion participants, but do not provide the explicit text of the real-time discussion. Accordingly, the text discussion script is adapted to guide real-time computer discussions or chats in a scalable, replicable way, while allowing participants to generate the actual discussion dialog. 
 In one implementation, a script introduction includes introductory text that is displayed for users considering participation in a real-time discussion that is guided by the text discussion script. Also, each scene may further include an advancement criterion that is time-based or controlled by one or more of the participants, as specified by the author. The designated participants indicate when they determine a scene to be completed so that the script can proceed to a subsequent scene. 
 The scripted text discussions provided by the present invention combine a structured, replicable and scalable discussion or chat environment that allows participants to communicate freely. Although analogous to some role-playing games, these scripted text discussions are socially oriented and do not require the involved interaction mechanisms (e.g., combat rules) commonly used in role-playing games to resolve player interactions. While suited to conventional recreational text discussion or chat applications, these scripted text discussions can also be used to structure on-line business interactions such as project meetings, to provide multi-user on-line training and team building, and as a platform for experiments in structured social interaction. 
 Additional objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the detailed description of the preferred embodiment thereof, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying drawings.

" The present invention has been made to solve the problems described above, and a main object thereof is to provide a game machine that is capable of clearly displaying gaming images and allows easy configuration of the rear side of a game board. 
 A game machine according to the present invention is a game machine comprising a display section that displays a gaming image thereon, and a game board that is formed to be capable of having gaming parts fixed thereto, and is disposed on a front side of the display section, such that game balls are movable on a front side thereof, wherein the game board has game ball passages formed through an inside thereof such that the game balls can pass through the game ball passages, and at the same time a part of the game board opposed to a part of the display section where the gaming image is displayed is formed of a light-pervious material. 
 In this game machine, the game ball passages through which game balls can pass are formed though the inside of the game board. This makes it possible to cause e.g. game balls having entered prize holes to pass through the game ball passages to be collected via the lowest part of the game board, without causing them to pass between the game board and the display section. Therefore, differently from the conventional game machines which cause game balls to pass between the game board and the display section, a protection plate for preventing breakage of the front side of the display section can be dispensed with, which makes it possible to view the gaming image with correspondingly increased clarity. Further, since the protection plate can be dispensed with, the rear side of the game board can be easily configured in a simplified manner. 
 In this case, it is preferred that the game board is formed by bonding together a plurality of plate-like members formed with cuts, grooves, or holes, or ones of at least two kinds of them, which form the game ball passages. This configuration of the game board enables each plate-like member to be formed reliably and easily by injection molding or the like, even if the shapes of game ball passages are complicated. 
 Further, a game board according to the present invention is a game machine comprising a display section that displays a gaming image thereon, and a game board that is formed to be capable of having gaming parts fixed thereto, and is disposed on a front side of the display section, such that game balls are movable on a front side thereof, wherein the game board has game ball passages formed on a front side thereof such that the game balls can pass through the game ball passages, and at the same time a part of the game board opposed to a part of the display section where the gaming image is displayed is formed of a light-pervious material. 
 In this game machine, the game ball passages through which game balls can pass are formed on the front side of the game board. This makes it possible, similarly to the game machine having the game ball passages formed through the inside of the game board, to dispense with a protection plate for preventing breakage of the front side of the display section, which makes it possible to clearly view the gaming image. Further, since the protection plate can be dispensed with, the rear side of the game board can be easily configured in a simplified manner. Moreover, since the cuts and the like for forming the game ball passages need not be formed in advance, it is possible to form the game board inexpensively.

" The problems of the prior art have been overcome by the present invention, which provides a system for minimizing the amount of traffic that traverses the fabric in support of the cache coherency protocol. The system of the present invention also allows rapid transmission of all traffic associated with the cache coherency protocol, so as to minimize latency and maximize performance. Briefly, a fabric is used to interconnect a number of processing units together. The switches that comprise the fabric are able to recognize incoming traffic related to the cache coherency protocol. These messages are then moved to the head of the switch's output queue to insure fast transmission throughout the fabric. In another embodiment, the traffic related to the cache coherency protocol can interrupt an outgoing message, further reducing latency through the switch, since the traffic does not need to wait for the current packet to be transmitted. 
 The switches within the fabric also incorporate at least one memory element, which is dedicated to analyzing and storing transactions related to the cache coherency protocol. This memory element tracks the contents of the caches of all of the processors connected to the switch. In this manner, traffic can be minimized. In a traditional NUMA system, read requests and invalidate messages are communicated with every other processor in the system. By tracking the contents of each processor's cache, the fabric can selectively transmit this traffic only to the processors where the data is resident in its cache.

" In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an electron emission device which minimizes the diffusion of electrons from the emitter toward not the phosphor at the relevant sub-pixel but incorrect phosphors to enhance the screen color representation. 
 In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, an electron emission device includes first and second substrates facing each other with a predetermined distance therebetween. Cathode electrodes and gate electrodes are formed on the first substrate and cross each other while interposing an insulation layer. Opening portions are formed at the gate electrodes and the insulation layer while exposing the cathode electrodes.

" The device according to the present invention and the method according to the present invention have the advantage over the related art that the ignition angle is initially advanced again more quickly after being retarded, and is advanced noticeably more slowly when approaching the knock limit. Thus, operation close to the knock limit is achieved at the same time, thereby achieving an improvement in efficiency and less occurrence of knocking, that is, less load on the internal combustion engine. The method according to the present invention thus has a much better control quality for knock control than the previously known method. 
 The adjustment of the ignition angle according to the present invention may be implemented quite easily by simply measuring the time since the last knock event occurred. The time measurement may involve counting the ignition events or monitoring a time counter. Furthermore, the rate of ignition advance may depend on the size of the interval between the current knock control retard adjustment and the knock limit. A further simple implementation of the ignition angle adjustment according to the present invention involves observing the size of the ignition angle knock portion and making the rate of adjustment dependent on the size of this ignition angle knock portion. It is in particular useful if not only the ignition angle base portion but the ignition angle knock portion as well is dependent on a load and rotational speed of the internal combustion engine.

" A coated glass mat comprises a glass mat substrate having non-woven glass fibers and a coating. The coating essentially uniformly penetrates the glass mat substrate to a desired fractional thickness of the coated glass mat. The coating imparts a tensile strength to the coated glass mat which on average is at least 1.33 times greater than the tensile strength of the glass mat substrate without the coating. On average, the weight of the coated glass mat per unit area is no more than about six times the weight of the glass mat substrate prior to coating. 
 In example embodiments, penetration of the coating into the glass mat substrate preferably extends to a depth of from twenty five percent of the thickness of the coated glass mat to seventy five percent of the thickness of the coated glass mat. Moreover, a non-coated thickness of the coated glass mat is sufficiently thick for bonding purposes with, e.g., a gypsum slurry or other core materials such as thermoplastic or thermosetting plastics. 
 The coating comprises a coating blend which provides the coated glass mat with a porosity sufficient to allow water vapor to escape from a gypsum slurry when heated. Preferably, such porosity is in a range from about 1.3 Cubic Feet per Minute (CFM) (all CFM data given are also “per square foot”) to about 5.0 CFM. The coating is preferably a coating blend comprised of water, latex binder, inorganic pigment, and inorganic binder. The CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute per Square Foot) porosity data shown in various Tables herein are determined by using ASTM D 737-96, “Standard Test Method for Air Permeability of Textile Fabrics.”
 The raw glass mat substrate has a weight which is between about twelve (12) pounds per thousand square feet and about fifty (50) pounds per thousand square feet. In one example, the glass mat substrate before coating weighs about fourteen and a half (14.5) pounds per thousand square feet. After coating the coated glass mat has a tensile strength which on average is greater than one hundred twenty pounds per three-inch width. In another example, the glass mat substrate before coating weighs about twenty-six and a half (26.5) pounds per thousand square feet. After coating the coated glass mat has a tensile strength which on average is greater than two hundred twenty pounds per three-inch width. 
 New coating methods which yield the coated glass mat expose a sufficient amount of coating to the glass mat to provide a uniform depth penetration and thereby achieve the increased tensile strength. The method facilitates a high degree of coating depth penetration (e.g., up to 75%) and yet no significant change in coating percentage composition by weight per square unit area. Because of the new coating techniques, the prior art glass mat substrate has a disproportionate increase in tensile strength relative to the increase in final product weight. The coated glass mat webs are much stronger and more weatherproof than prior art similar webs. 
 One of the new coating techniques involves increasing a wrap angle of the glass mat substrate around an applicator roll thereby increasing exposure of the coating to the glass mat substrate. 
 Other new coating techniques, which permits utilization of a non-increased wrap angle, involves providing a friction-enhancing surface configuration for the application roller, e.g., a surface configuration that is non-smooth and which has greater friction than a smooth surface. In one embodiment, the friction-enhancing surface configuration can involve scoring, cutting, or otherwise forming grooves or depressions in an exterior surface of the applicator roll. In another embodiment, which also permits utilization of a non-increased wrap angle, involves coating or otherwise applying a rough surface material to an exterior surface of an applicator roll. Other techniques also provide a substantial increase in tensile strength.
","1. An apparatus for making a coated glass mat comprising: 
an applicator roll which applies a coating to a glass mat substrate traveling thereby; 
wherein the applicator roll supplies a sufficient amount of the coating to the glass mat substrate whereby the coating only partially penetrates a thickness of the glass mat substrate but imparts a tensile strength to the coated glass mat which on average is at least 1.33 times greater than the tensile strength of the glass mat substrate without the coating."

","1. A process for producing a lumber type product from scrap carpet, comprising in combination: 
shredding the scrap carpet; 
grinding the shredded carpet;

" In conventional combine harvesters crop material is fed between a threshing cylinder and an associated threshing concave, which extend transversely to the direction of combine travel. Here, the crop is threshed over a comparatively short distance. Axial flow machines, on the other hand, use one or more longitudinally arranged rotors and associated concaves. 
 Generally, each rotor includes a threshing section, which immediately follows an infeed section, the infeed section generally delivering the crop material to the rotor. A separating section follows the threshing section. The threshing section has a plurality of sets of rasp bars, such as a leading rasp bar and a trailing rasp bar, which are provided at predetermined positions around the periphery of the threshing section of the rotor. The crop material is threshed along the longitudinal extent defined by the rotor, which results in increased harvesting efficiency because a higher degree of separation is reached and grain losses are reduced. 
 Accordingly, axial flow combines are popular in regions with a continental climate, where the crops to be harvested ripen well and contain hardly any green parts at the time of the harvest. However, when the crop contains green material, such axial flow units can be particularly prone to plugging by slugs of accumulated crop material that lodge between the leading and trailing rasp bars of the rotor and the concaves. 
 For this reason, it is advantageous that selected ones or all of the trailing rasp bars be removably mounted on the rotor to allow the rotor to be adapted to suit the crop being harvested. However, removal of every trailing rasp bar from the rotor, especially from near the end of the thresher section adjacent the separator section, can result in an uneven crop flow from the thresher section into the separator section of the rotor. This uneven crop flow can also cause plugging. 
 With a view toward mitigating the foregoing disadvantage, the present invention provides an axial flow combine harvester comprising a rotor having a thresher section and a separator section. The thresher section includes pairs of rasp bars, such as a leading rasp bar and a trailing rasp bar. The pairs of rasp bars are preferably staggered from one another along a helical path of the rotor. Individual trailing rasp bars of at least each of the pairs of rasp bars are removable to render the action of the thresher section less aggressive. More specifically, a flow deflector plate can be mounted in the position of the removed trailing rasp bar to guide the crop flow continuously from the remaining, leading rasp bar into the separator section of the rotor. 
 Preferably, the flow deflector plate includes a first section that extends generally tangentially with respect to the rotor in line with serrations of the remaining, leading rasp bar. The flow detector plate also preferably includes a second section for deflecting the crop to follow a helical path into the separator section of the rotor. 
 The height of the first section of the deflector plate may be ramped upward from the height of the remaining, leading rasp bar on the threshing section and increase at the second section to the same radial height as defined by the crop engaging blades of the separator section. 
 Accordingly, the present invention discloses an axial flow combine harvester with adaptable threshing unit, which may be used in continental climates where crops to be ripen well or which may be adapted for use with crops that contain green parts at the time of harvest and which are susceptible to plugging of the rotor under normal circumstances.

" Many products are produced in an air or liquid tight manner for environmental, health, freshness, operational and/or other reasons. To meet the need for seal-tight products, test equipment has been developed to test certain types of products for leaks using air tests utilizing micro-flow sensors. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,861,546 to Sagi et al., the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference, discloses a leak detection apparatus that is suitable for detecting leaks in a product having an opening to which a leak sensor and a vacuum system may be coupled to form a closed test system. 
 Conventional leak testing systems and methods employ procedures wherein an individual leak test lasts a predetermined amount of time. Each product under test is subjected to the same test time period, regardless of whether the product has a gross leak which is apparent immediately, a marginal leak, an insignificant leak, or no leak at all. Consequently, a given number of products require a relatively fixed period of time for testing. 
 The present invention provides a method by which the period of time for testing a particular product for leaks is variable and dynamically changes depending upon leak characteristics of the product in the on-going test such as the leakage flowrate and the stability of the leakage flowrate. Thus, it is possible to test a larger number of products in a given period of time as compared to conventional techniques. 
 These and other features of the present methods and apparatuses will become apparent and be further understood upon reading the detailed description provided below with reference to the following drawings.
","1. A method of testing a product for leaks, comprising the steps of: 
applying a reference pressure to one of an interior and an exterior of the product; 
developing a gas flow through a sensor in response to applying the reference pressure; and 
determining based upon the gas flow, whether the product has one of a gross leak, a marginal leak, and an insignificant leak."
" According to the techniques of the present invention, once barcode data has been read from an image file, it is stored as a character string within an auxiliary field of the image file. An example of such an auxiliary field is a comment field of a Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) or JPEG File Interchange Format OFIF, commonly called JPEG) file; such comment fields are generally available in many image file formats. Subsequently, the data can be read from the auxiliary field, thus avoiding the need to use considerable processing power and memory resources to extract the encoded data. The present invention thus facilitates access to barcode data by devices and applications that would otherwise lack the hardware and/or software resources to read and decode barcode data. 
 Once a barcode has been initially read and decoded, several facts are known about the barcode, including its location, the symbology used, and the data represented by the barcode. Additional information can also be extracted, such as the rotation of the barcode, the width of the smallest line (the x-width), and the contrast or difference in brightness between the lines and spaces. Depending on the particular application, some or all of this information might be considered useful; for example, some applications might only need the barcode data, while other applications may need some of the other information listed above. 
 According to the techniques of the present invention, once a barcode has been read, any or all of the information is encoded as a character string, for example in Extended Markup Language (XML) format, and stored in an auxiliary field or in a separate file that is somehow associated with or linked to the image file. Then, any other application requiring access to the barcode data can read the data from the auxiliary field or separate file instead of searching the image and decoding the barcode itself. 
 Since parsing an XML file (or other representation of the barcode) is significantly less processor- and memory-intensive than barcode data decoding, the present invention provides an effective mechanism for improving the efficiency of extracting and reading such information from image files. 
 In addition, in some situations the installation of barcode reader software entails a fee or royalty. The present invention avoids repeated reading of the same barcode; once the barcode is read a first time on one device, it need not be read again on a second device, since the barcode data is available from an auxiliary field. Thus, the user of the present invention can avoid paying a royalty each time the barcode data is needed on a separate device.

" The present invention relates to a bar clamp with adjustable jaw pads for clamping and for spreading work pieces. It includes a main housing having a bar opening for extending a bar there through, and a bar advancing mechanism with a bar gripping member in proximity to the bar opening. There is an elongated slide bar extending through the bar opening of the main housing for relative movement of the bar through the main housing, and a handle and trigger connected to the main housing wherein the trigger is connected to the bar advancing mechanism of the main housing such that activation of the trigger causes advancement of the bar through the main housing. The main housing internal mechanisms for moving, locking, and unlocking are well known and within the abilities of the artisan. The prior art cited above illustrates various internal movement, hold and release mechanisms that may be employed in the main housing of the present invention. 
 The present invention also includes a first jaw base connected to the main housing and extending upwardly therefrom. A first jaw pad is rotatably connected to the first jaw base, and is rotatable in a first plane so as to adjust an angle between the elongated slide bar and the first jaw pad. There is a rotating means for rotating the first jaw pad in a second plane, relative to the elongated slide bar. 
 A separate, second jaw base is connected to the elongated slide bar, and this connection may be fixed or moveable, and moveable preferred. There is a second jaw pad rotatably connected to the second jaw base, and it is rotatable in a third plane so as to adjust an angle between the elongated slide bar and the second jaw pad. In some embodiments there is a second rotating means for rotation of the second jaw pad in a fourth plane relative to the elongated slide bar. The first plane and the third plane may be parallel or non-parallel and the second plane and fourth plane may likewise be parallel or non-parallel. 
 When the second jaw base is moveably connected to the elongated slide bar, it is preferably lockable on the elongated slide bar, and the second jaw base includes a lock means and a release means. This lock means and release means may be a friction lock with a spring biased release mechanism. 
 While the jaw pads of the present invention are generally flat, and are illustrated herein as flat, they may have a three dimensional topography (e.g. with serration or dimpling or reverse dimpling), and/or be curvilinear in one or two planes, so as to accommodate non-flat work pieces. They may be curved in a single plane (simple arc) or hemispherical (rotated arc of constant radius). They may be connected flat or curved sections of different planes connected to one another. They may be irregular cup shaped to accommodate a particular workpiece (rotatable arc of variable radii). They may be conical, truncated conical or any combination of all of the above, or any other gripping or holding shape. They could optionally or additionally base one or more suction cups or other fastening assist mechanisms on the jaw pads. 
 In some preferred embodiments, the second jaw base is removable from and directionally reversible relative to the elongated slide bar so that it is convertible from a clamping to a spreading device. When it is removed and reversed it may be attached to the elongated slide bar on the opposite end of the elongated slide bar so that the jaw pad is away from and faces opposite from the first jaw pad to create the spreading feature. Alternatively, one or both of the jaw pads may be flipped over the top of its base to face a generally opposite direction to shift from clamping to spreading and vice versa. 
 In some preferred embodiments, at least one of the first jaw pad and the second jaw pad, and preferably both, includes a jaw pad lock and release mechanism for selectively maintaining an angle between it and its base, and hence the elongated slide bar. The jaw pad lock and release mechanism may include a rotating, threaded lock that may be rotated in a first direction to lock a jaw pad at a selected angle, and rotated in a second, opposite direction to unlock said jaw pad. 
 In other preferred embodiments, at least one of the first jaw pad and the second jaw pad includes a one or more angle selection and lock mechanism arrangements. 
 The angle selection and lock mechanism arrangements may include a ratchet and gear mechanism to enable finer selection of angles. A calibration or angle scale could be shown on the side of or on a dial to further improve angle selection.

" I. Solved Problems 
 1. Conventional physical fitness equipment utilize weights to adjust force exertion. The said stretching or chest enlargement requires that the user apply greater or lesser amounts of strength sufficient to pull the weight and, furthermore, muscles are readily susceptible to strain injuries. 
 2. The said physical fitness regimen is strenuous and the main result is more robust muscles, with the stretching providing virtually no benefit for the blood circulation system, not to mention respiratory development—both of which cannot be significantly improved by physical fitness equipment—and if an excessive amount of weight is used in order to do so by such a forced, unnatural means, the risk of internal injury is very high. 
 II. Method of Solution 
 1. The invention herein utilizes a mechanical apparatus having a swinging appendage movably mounted on each of its two sides, each said swinging appendage is linked to a sleeve and, furthermore, the said sleeve is fastened onto a screw rod utilizing a powering speed reduction motor for forward/reverse control such that the screw rod shifts the sleeve upward and downward, simultaneously causing the two swinging appendages to ascend and descend; when the user lies on a bed with the head resting on the pillow of the apparatus body in a relaxed and natural posture, the user spreads out the arms on the swinging appendages and personally controls the articulatory angle and speed of the swinging appendages to thereby stretch the circulatory system of the arms as well as perform chest enlargement and respiratory exercises. 
 2. The invention herein utilizes the said swinging appendages in an adjustable horizontal angular arrangement to accommodate the swinging appendage positions desired by the user, thereby providing for omnidirectional positioning utilization requirements.

The said apparatus body has an internally installed speed reduction motor, a sleeve is positioned on its driven screw rod, and a support rod is movably linked to each of the two sides of the said sleeve and, furthermore, each said support rod is extended and movably coupled to a swinging appendage, each said swinging appendage is affixed onto a hinge, and the said two hinges are each mounted on the two sides of the said apparatus body such that the said speed reduction motor rotates and controls the said sleeve to drive the said support rods, thereby raising and lowering the said swinging appendages to stretch the circulatory system of the arms, while also providing for chest enlargement and respiratory exercise."
" Due to the parameters required by the Beer-Lambert law, the difficulties in detecting glucose concentration arise from the difficulty in determining the exact path length through a medium (resulting from transforming the multi-path signal to an equivalent single-path signal), as well as difficulties encountered due to low signal strength resultant from a low concentration of blood glucose. Path length through a medium such as a fingertip or earlobe is very difficult to determine, because not only are optical wavelengths absorbed differently by the fleshy medium, but also the signals are scattered within the medium and transmitted through different paths. Furthermore, as indicated by the above equation (2), the measured signal intensity at a given wavelength does not vary linearly with respect to the path length. Therefore, variations in path length of multiple paths of light through the medium do not result in a linear averaging of the multiple path lengths. Thus, it is often very difficult to determine an exact path length through a fingertip or earlobe for each wavelength. 
 In conventional spectroscopic blood constituent measurements, such a blood oxygen saturation, light is transmitted at various wavelengths through the fleshy medium. The fleshy medium (containing blood) attenuates the incident light and the detected signal can be used to calculate certain saturation values. In conventional spectroscopic blood constituent measurements, the heart beat provides a minimal modulation to the detected attenuated signal in order to allow a computation based upon the AC portion of the detected signal with respect to the DC portion of the detected signal, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,407,290. This AC/DC operation normalizes the signal and accounts for variations in the pathlengths, as well understood in the art. 
 However, the natural heart beat generally provides approximately a 1-10% modulation (AC portion of the total signal) of the detected signal when light is transmitted through a patient's digit or the like. That is, the variation in attenuation of the signal due to blood may be only 1% of the total attenuation (other attenuation being due to muscle, bone, flesh, etc.). In fact, diabetes patients typically have even lower modulation (e.g., 0.01-0.1%). Therefore, the attenuation variation (AC portion of the total attenuation) due to natural pulse can be extremely small. In addition, the portion of the pulse modulation which is due to glucose is roughly only 9% of the pulse (approximately 1/11) at a wavelength of 1330-1340 nm where glucose absorbs effectively. Furthermore, to resolve glucose from 5 mg/dl to 1005 mg/dl in increments or steps of 5 mg/dl, requires resolution of 1/200 of the 9% of the modulation which is due to glucose. Accordingly, by way of three different examples—one for a healthy individual, one for a diabetic with a strong pulse, and one for a diabetic with a weak pulse—for absorption at 1330 nm, the system would require resolution as follows. 
","1. A system for non-invasively monitoring concentrations of blood constituents in a living subject, said system comprising: 
a light source at a measurement site configured to irradiate a fleshy medium of a living subject with radiation at a plurality of wavelengths selected for attenuation sensitivity to at least one of a plurality of blood constituent concentrations, said plurality of blood constituent concentrations including a glucose concentration; 
an optical detector positioned at said measurement site to detect light which has been attenuated by said fleshy medium, said optical detector configured to generate an output signal indicative of the intensity of said radiation after attenuation through said fleshy medium;

a pressure application device at a location different from said measurement site which causes a change in a volume of blood in the fleshy medium at said measurement site sufficient to alter said output signal to increase a likelihood that said signal processor can determine at least said glucose concentration."
" Aspects of the present invention are therefore directed to an improved sensor board that includes a “comb” pattern of sensing traces that form various sensing loops. This comb arrangement of traces may be fabricated using only a single layer per sensing axis. Thus, a digitizer may be fabricated in a technology, such as indium tin oxide on glass, that cannot provide plated-through holes. 
 Further aspects of the present invention provide a highly compact layout of sensing traces, thus allowing the sensor board to be smaller. Where the sensor board is integrated with a display such as a liquid crystal display, the amount by which the sensor board exceeds the size of the active digitizer area may be reduced as compared with conventional integrated displays/digitizers. 
 Still further aspects of the present invention provide a set of sensing traces that are switchable so as to dynamically allow sensing loops to be defined in various sizes and directions in a flexible manner. For example, a given pair of sensing traces may be configured to define either a clockwise or counter-clockwise sensing loop as desired. 
 These and other features of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of the embodiments.
","1. An electromagnetic digitizer sensor coupled to a processor, comprising: 
a first array of sensing loops each coupled between the processor and a first potential node, each sensing loop in the first array being selectively connectable to the processor and further being selectively connectable to the first potential node."
" The foregoing problems with the prior state of the art are overcome by the principles of the present invention which are directed towards an optical transceiver. The optical transceiver includes a laser driver. The laser driver drives a laser diode with a signal sequence. The speed of transition of the signal sequence tends to reduce as a bias current provided to the laser driver is reduced, and tends to increase as the bias current is increased. 
 In accordance with the principles of the present invention, the optical transceiver protects against undershooting and overshooting of the optical signal by imposing a reduction in transition speed at low temperatures. Specifically, a preliminary current generation circuit generating a preliminary current. In addition, a programmable cold temperature bias current compensation circuit draws a configurable amount of current from the preliminary current if the ambient temperature is below a threshold temperature to generate a final current. A laser driver bias current delivery circuit then provides at least one laser driver bias current to the laser driver. These delivered bias currents are dependent at least in part upon the final current. 
 Accordingly, the principles of the present invention allow for a reduction of transition speed at cold temperatures thereby reducing or eliminating overshoot and undershoot. This, in turn, reduces jitter and electromagnetic interference. Furthermore, the user may program how much transition speed reduction occurs at cold temperatures. Finally, as will be explained below, the preliminary current generation circuit, the programmable cold temperature bias current compensation circuit, and the laser driver bias current delivery circuit may be integrated on the same chip as the laser driver. Accordingly, cold temperature transition time adjustment may occur even without the assistance of an external controller. 
 Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description that follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by the practice of the invention. The features and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of the instruments and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.

" It is an object of the present invention to provide a connection oriented network with means for automatically tracing active connection modify failures. 
 Accordingly, the invention provides a method for identifying the failure and failure node of an active connection modify in a connection oriented communication network. The method comprises the steps of: appending a trace transit list information element (TTL IE) to a Modify Request message; transmitting the Modify Request message from a source node to a destination node along the active connection; and at each node along the active connection, modifying a parameter of the active connection while recording in the TTL IE logical node and logical port information which will be used for failure node identification. 
 If a node along the active connection does not enable modification of the parameter, the method according to the invention provides for generating a Modify Reject message at the failing node along the connection; updating the TTL IE with failure cause information; and appending this TTL IE to the Modify Reject message and returning the Modify Reject message to the source node. 
 The method of the present invention provides the ability to immediately identify the node at which the ACM failure occurred and provides more detailed vendor specific information on the cause of the failure. Since this information is automatically collected, the operator is not required to view the available resources on each node along the connection to determine which node had insufficient resources to apply the ACM request, or did not support the ACM service. As a result, the skill level requirements of an operator and the time for identifying the faulty node are reduced, resulting in a reduction in network operating costs. 
 Also, since identification of the cause and location of an ACM failure is automatic, human error is practically eliminated.

" The present invention eliminates the problem of reintroduction of air into the bundle housing between uses preferably by enclosing the axially joined filter elements (the hollow fiber bundle and carbon elements) within an impervious shroud that maintains the water level in contact with the hollow fibers. Thus, between uses, the water within the hollow fiber housing is not allowed to drain, preventing the accumulation of additional air that must be voided for full efficiency. This same approach has been employed in other designs disclosed in this application to preclude the water from draining from the hollow fiber membrane filter. A second method that may be used when the water intake is at the base of the housing and the filter is positioned at the base of a water bottle or canteen is to employ a one-way valve which will not permit the water to drain back into the bottle or container. 
 In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a water filter is cooperable with a water container. The water filter includes a carbon composite filter and a bundle of sub-micro porous hollow fiber membranes in fluid communication with the carbon composite filter. The carbon composite filter and the hollow fiber bundle are arranged in the water container such that untreated water is first treated with the carbon composite filter and then directed to the hollow fiber bundle. An influent side of the hollow fiber bundle is continuously immersed in water, whereby air is prevented from being re-introduced to the hollow fiber bundle from outside the water filter between inversions of the water container or when the water container is upright. 
 In another exemplary embodiment of the invention, a filtration system for filtering water includes a water container and the water filter according to the present invention. 
 In still another exemplary embodiment of the invention, a dual component water filter includes a hollow fiber membrane bundle and a screen pre-filter. The hollow fiber membrane bundle and the screen pre-filter are contained within a single housing, wherein the housing retains water within the hollow fiber membrane bundle and the screen pre-filter.

" A new class of ceramic (CRB ceramic) as described later, representing further improvement on RB ceramic, is a ceramic material friendly to nature, obtained by using rice bran as a raw material, and by mixing degreased bran derived from the rice bran with a thermosetting resin before firing. CRB ceramic has the following excellent features: 



 very high hardness 
 very small expansion coefficient 
 porous organization structure 
 good electrical conductivity 
 small specific gravity and light weight 
 very small friction coefficient 
 excellent wear resistance 
 easy to mold or to form in a die 
 a small contraction ratio of the dimensions of a finished product to those of a formed workpiece 
 ceramic material having varying features can be produced by mixing with a variety of resins 
 the raw material being rice bran, there is little adverse effect on global environment, leading to conservation of natural resources. 




 Accordingly, it can be said that this ceramic material has conditions suitable for application to a special type bearing device, such as insusceptibility to damage, light weight, a long service life, capability of retaining oil and grease for a long period of time, and so forth. 
 The ceramic (CRB ceramic) described above is an improved material of RB ceramic, that is, a black resin or porous ceramic, obtained by mixing degreased bran derived from rice bran with a thermosetting resin before kneading, subjecting a kneaded mixture thus obtained to a primary firing in an inert gas at a temperature in a range of 700 to 1000° C., pulverizing the kneaded mixture after the primary firing into carbonized powders passing through a 100-mesh sieve, mixing the carbonized powders with a thermosetting resin before kneading, pressure-forming a kneaded mixture at pressure in a range of 20 to 30 MPa, and subjecting a formed workpiece thus obtained again to a heat treatment in an inert gas atmosphere at a temperature in a range of 100 to 1100° C. CRB ceramic differs largely from RB ceramic in that in contrast with RB ceramic having a contraction ratio of the dimensions of a finished product thereof to those of a formed workpiece at as high as 25%, CRB ceramic has a very small contraction ratio at not more than 3%, rendering it superior to RB ceramic. 
 The inventor has discovered that special type bearing devices having a variety of features can be fabricated with ease by applying CRB ceramic as material for at least a part of the respective special type bearing devices. 
 In another aspect of the present invention, the dimensions of a workpiece already formed of RB ceramic can be properly adjusted by shaving the same although the conventional RB ceramic has a contraction ratio of the dimensions of a finished product thereof to those of the workpiece already formed at as high as 25%, and therefore, the invention does not exclude embodiments thereof, using RB ceramic. Because RB ceramic has substantially the same property as that of CRB ceramic except in respect of the dimensions of the finished product thereof, the invention does not exclude embodiments thereof, using RB ceramic, in this regard either. 
 In carrying out the invention, however, it is preferable to use mainly CRB ceramic because a product of high-precision dimensions can be obtained through one forming process in this case. 
 Further, it has been discovered that special type bearing devices having a variety of features can be fabricated by introducing novel configurations to contact parts of the system as well as by suitable combination of material used for a conventional special type bearing device made of synthetic resin with material used for a conventional special type bearing device made of steel based metal. 
 More specifically, the invention provides a special type bearing device comprising an axis, a rotating body or rotating bodies, fixedly attached to the axis or formed integrally therewith, and a supporting body with which the rotating body or the rotating bodies are in contact, wherein at least a part of the axis, the rotating body or the rotating bodies, and the supporting body is made of RB ceramic or CRB ceramic.

The operational modes might include digitize mode, layback mode, and edit and dub modes, with the digitize and layback modes further subdivided into modes that bypass internal or external faders or modes that include, i.e., are routed through, internal or external faders. The selection of a particular desired operational mode adaptively configures the program signal matrix to direct program signals along a default signal path devised to route the signals between the source and destination, while disabling any potential feedback signal paths. 
 In one particular aspect of the invention, the intelligent control platform includes internal fader controls, with the default signal path configurable to direct program signals through the faders in the first operational mode (digitize or layback via faders). The default signal path is further configurable to direct signals such that they bypass the faders in a second operational mode (digitize or layback bypass faders). 
 In further aspect of the invention, the intelligent control platform further includes means for coupling the default signal path through an external mixer. As was the case with the internal faders, the default signal path is configurable to direct program signals through the mixer in a first operational mode and to direct signals such that they bypass the mixer in a second operational mode. 
 In yet a further aspect of the invention, the program signal matrix is configurable to allow manual access to certain output ports where the selection of those output ports are appropriate to the operational mode defining the default signal path. The program signal matrix is configured in such a manner that inappropriate signal paths, that would result in feedback or misdirected signals, are disabled from user selection when the particular selected operational mode would preclude such selection.

" The present invention is directed to the discovery that the benefits of split stream processing can be more fully realized when the split streams are re-combined under specific processing conditions. In particular, under specified conditions of shear and heat, the potential viscosity of the thick stream is fully harvested. The amount of shear used in accordance with the invention is significantly greater than the amount required to reconstitute at least some prior pastes. 
 For a more complete of the above and other features and advantages of the invention, reference should be made to the following description of the preferred embodiment. 
 In accordance with the invention, recombination of the thick and thin streams under the conditions of the invention permits formation of a thicker paste than would have been expected. Thus, either a thicker paste product results, or, the thicker paste can be diluted, thereby conserving resources and minimizing cost to the consumer. If desired, in accordance with the invention a paste can be produced having tomato soluble solids level reductions of up to 20%, especially from 5 to 10% with little or no reduction in Bostwick viscosity. The invention thus permits manufacture of a thicker product from the re-combined stream while the enhanced flavor of split stream processed products are obtained. 
 In accordance with a preferred aspect of the invention, the streams are recombined in an amount of approximately 90% of the normal recombination amount for the thick stream and 75% of the normal amount for the thin stream. Use of lower amounts of the streams relative to normal recombination ratios makes available more water for hydration and preserves tomato resources. It is expected that beneficial results will be obtained when the amounts range from 60 to 100% of the normal amount for the thick steam and from 40 to 100% of the normal amount for the thick stream. 
 Preferably, the thick and thin streams are recombined and subject to shear in a first step. In one or more subsequent steps, then, the recombined and sheared streams are again sheared and are heated. In the first shearing step, the re-combined streams are preferably subjected to shear in the range of from 150 sec-1 to 1000 sec-1, especially from 300 sec-1 to 600 sec-1. The heating step involves subjecting the recombined stream, preferably before or during shearing, to temperatures of from at least 130° F. to 212° F., especially from 145° F. to 165° F. 
",1. A process of preparing a tomato product comprising re-combining thick and thin streams and subjecting the re-combined streams at a temperature of at least 150° F. to shear of from 150 sec-1 to 1000 sec-1.
" A phase locked loop comprises a phase-frequency detector coupled to receive a reference signal, wherein the phase-frequency detector produces a phase control signal, a charge pump for producing a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) control signal based upon the phase control signal, a VCO for producing an oscillation having a frequency based upon the VCO control signal, and a low-noise divider for producing a low phase noise divided oscillation. 
 The low noise divider further includes a pulse-swallow configured divider comprising a pre-scaled divider block and first and second divider blocks wherein the pre-scaled divider block is biased by a first bias signal and wherein the first and second dividers are biased for digital operation. The pre-scaled divider block produces a pre-scaled divider output based upon the oscillation. The first divider block produces a divided oscillation based upon the pre-scaled divider output that is operably coupled to a first latching block. 
 The first latching block latches the divided oscillation based upon the pre-scaled divider output as a clock to produce a first latched signal. A second latching block latches the first latched signal based upon the VCO oscillation as a clock to produce a second latched signal. A third latching block latches the second latched signal based upon the VCO oscillation as a clock to produce a third latched signal, wherein the third latched signal is the low phase noise divided oscillation and is produced to the phase-frequency detector for comparison to a reference signal. 
 The first and second latching blocks are biased by the first bias signal and the third latching block is biased by a second bias signal wherein the second bias signal is greater in magnitude than the first bias signal. The first, second, and third latching blocks each contain an output load device wherein the output load device of the third latching block has a smaller impedance than an impedance of the output load devices of the first and second latching blocks. The impedance of the third latching block output load device is selected to produce a specified voltage swing and to minimize thermal and flicker noise. The impedance of the first and second latching block output load devices are selected to produce a desired signal level to the third latching block. 
 In an alternate embodiment of the PLL, a buffer is operably coupled between the VCO output and the low-noise divider input wherein the buffer produces a buffered oscillation to the pulse-swallow configured divider module in the low-noise divider. The buffer decouples the VCO output from switching noise generated by the pulse-swallow configured divider so that the VCO oscillation produced to the third latching block is substantially noise free. A pre-scaled divider in the pulse-swallow configured divider module produces a pre-scaled divider output based upon the buffered oscillation produced by the buffer. In this embodiment, the third latching block is clocked by the VCO oscillation and the second latching block is clocked by the buffered oscillation.

" An object of the present invention is to provide organic chelates having perfect ionic and coordination bonds between an amino acid and a metal ion. 
 To achieve this object, the present invention provides a preparation method of organic chelate having the following chemical formula 1. The present invention comprises the steps of: (1) dissolving in water an amino acid and a salt containing mineral to form coordination bonds and precipitating hydroxide salt by sodium or potassium hydroxide; (2) removing water soluble salts such as potassium sulfates, sodium sulfates, potassium chlorides, or sodium chlorides by a filter press; (3) dissolving the filtered hydroxide mineral of M(OH)2 (where, M is a metal ion) in hydrochloric acid; (4) mixing amino acid by completely dissolving in the above solution; (5) titrating the amino acid solution slowly with sodium hydroxide upto the pI value of methionine solution; and (6) filtering and drying the particles formed by the titration.  




 wherein M is a divalent metal ion such as copper, iron, zinc, manganese, and cobalt, and R is a side chain of amino acid. 

 In the above preparation method, the step (4) of mixing an amino acid is carried out by mixing two equivalents of completely dissolved amino acid with one equivalent of a metal in the solution containing salt free metal hydroxide dissolved in hydrochloric acid. Metal sulfate or metal chloride is used to prepare metal hydroxide. The metal hydroxide is precipitated in the reaction between metal salt and sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. It is necessary to remove residual salt, as possible, such as sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, sodium chloride, or potassium chloride, because perfect chelate formation is hindered due to the formation of ionic bonding between residual sodium or potassium ions and amino acids. 
 In the above preparation method, the step (5) of titration is carried out by adding sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide of equivalent weight to the hydrochloric acid added to help dissolving metal hydroxide. 
 The amino acids used in the present invention are not limited to specific amino acids, however methionine is preferably utilized. 
 Although the prior art somewhat induces chelating bond in terms of chemical equation, perfect chelation is not formed according to the properties of mineral, because the supply of only OH− ion is not possible in the titration step to the increase of pH for the bonding between a mineral and an amino acid and also excessive sodium or potassium ions from sodium or potassium hydroxide combines with COO− ion of amino acid. This is a problem in the prior art. 
 However, according to the present invention, the aqueous solution of salt containing mineral for the formation of coordination with an amino acid is added to sodium or potassium hydroxide so that salt free metal hydroxide is obtained. The metal hydroxide dissolved in hydrochloric acid contains abundant OH− ions, which remove H+ from —NH3+ in amino acid and induce perfect coordination bond between a metal ion and an amino acid.

2) removing water soluble salts such as potassium sulfate, sodium sulfate, potassium chloride or sodium chloride from a aqueous solution by filter press; 
3) dissolving the filtered metal hydroxides M(OH)2 (wherein M is a metal ion) in hydrochloric acid; 
4) dissolving an amino acid completely and mixing in the solution;

" According to one aspect of the invention a new tree-like structure is created. The tree-like structure, known as a disjoint graph, enables packet classification in only one pass of the tree. 
 The disjoint graph is comprised of two new types of data structures: an elementary interval tree (EIT) and a disjoint interval (DIT). The disjoint graph is constructed based on a range-specified rule set for classifying packets. Each rule in the rule set has an equal number of fields, D, and each field specifies a range, referred to as an integer interval, having a lower and an upper bound. The disjoint graph has the same number of layers, D, as there are fields in each rule. The layers are comprised of nodes, and each node has an associated rule set selected from the original (range-specified) rule set. 
 The first layer of the disjoint graph is an EIT. The remaining layers comprise a set of DITs and a set of EITs. The set of DITs at a given layer are constructed for the integer intervals stored in each node of the EITs in the preceding layer. The set of EITs at a given layer are constructed for the integer intervals stored in each node of the DITs of that layer. The associated rule set of a node of an EIT in a j-th layer contains rules whose j-th field contains the elementary interval stored in the node. The associated rule set of a node of a DIT in a j-th layer contains rules whose j-th field is contained by the disjoint interval stored in the node. 
 Elementary intervals are non-overlapping integer intervals. Disjoint intervals are intervals formed from overlapping integer intervals by combining them to form integer intervals that are disjoint from each other.

" In one embodiment, a wireless communication device incorporates a digital variable gain amplifier (DVGA) that has an improved architecture. The DVGA may include a multiplier to multiply an M-bit baseband sample by an N-bit gain factor to generate a product having M+N bits. The DVGA may also include a shift register to shift the M-bit baseband sample by N bits to generate a shifted value having M+N bits. The DVGA may also include a bit selector that generates an output by selecting at least a subset of M+N+1 bits of a sum of the product and the shifted value. The output of the DVGA can be provided to a demodulation unit for demodulation. By avoiding truncation of the M+N bit product to match the bit size of the baseband sample, and instead shifting the baseband sample by N bits to match the M+N bit size of the product, performance of the DVGA can be enhanced. In particular, the input amplitude for small signals may converge to a desired level more smoothly compared to DVGAs in which the bits of the product of the input signal and the gain factor are rounded or truncated. 
 In another embodiment, a wireless communication device includes an automatic gain control unit that measures a power level of baseband samples and accumulates differences between the measured power levels and a set point. The wireless communication device may also include a DVGA that adjusts a gain factor as a function of the accumulation and applies the adjusted gain factor to scale the baseband samples. Because measured power level differences are accumulated, and used to adjust the gain factor, the architecture can avoid conversions of the power level differences prior to accumulation. In this manner, the architecture can be simplified. 
 Various embodiments may be implemented in software, hardware, firmware, or any combination thereof. Additional details of various embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below.

Significantly, it has been determined that the erosion rate of the DLC layer during a CMP polishing step is approximately constant, regardless of the diameter range chosen for the projecting test features, and the DLC erosion rate corresponds to the rate of polishing on the critical device features in a linear manner. Therefore, projecting test features of one array can be fabricated with a diameter chosen such that the DLC surface of the projecting test features is eroded in a particular time, such as 40 seconds. The projecting test features of an adjacent array can be fabricated with a larger diameter that is chosen such that the DLC surface is completely removed in a different time, such as 45 seconds. Thus, a series of arrays can be arranged next to each other, where the diameters of the projecting test features are chosen such that the DLC surface of the projecting test features is removed in specifically designed time increments, such as 5 second increments, from array to array. 
 It is to be understood that each of the projecting test features is too small to be viewed utilizing an optical microscope. However, where a plurality of such test features is created in close proximity to each other, such as in an array, which may have area of approximately 400 square microns, and therefore the entire array is visible utilizing an optical microscope. A dark field optical microscope is preferably utilized, as the arrays having projecting test features with the DLC surface completely removed appear as bright white, while the arrays with test features that retain some DLC surface are significantly darker. The operator, viewing through the dark field optical microscope, can count the number of arrays that reveal a high image contrast, thereby indicating the corresponding CMP process progress. 
 As a result, CMP process control of delicate features that are too small to be viewed utilizing an optical microscope, can be obtained by fabricating arrays that include a plurality of projecting test features which when viewed together in an array are visible utilizing the dark field optical microscope. CDSEM methodology may also be used as a complimentary tool for further process diagnostic and fine tuning. The overall benefit of this method is that it combines a quick and simple CMP process control at an operator level utilizing a dark field optical microscope, and a precise CMP process engineering level fine tuning utilizing a CDSEM when it is needed. 
 It is an advantage of the CMP control process of the present invention that a relatively inexpensive optical microscope can be utilized to provide CMP process control of delicate features that are too small to be seen utilizing an optical microscope. 
 It is another advantage of the CMP control process of the present invention that the polishing of features that are only a fraction of a micron in size can be controlled utilizing a conventional optical microscope. 
 It is a further advantage of the CMP process control of the present invention that a plurality of arrays can be created on a wafer surface that provide a time intervalled polishing indication. 
 It is yet another advantage of the CMP control process of the present invention that a more rapid, less expensive method for polishing control is provided. 
 It is yet a further advantage of the CMP control process of the present invention that it combines a quick and simple CMP process control at an operator level utilizing optical microscopes, and a precise CMP process engineering fine tuning utilizing a CDSEM when it is needed.

 The method of measuring distance of the present invention includes the steps of providing an optical emitter and an optical sensor that are aligned with one another. An interrupter pin is movably positioned between the optical emitter and the optical sensor. When the interrupter pin is positioned between the optical emitter and the optical sensor, an amount of optical radiation passes from the optical emitter to the optical sensor. The amount of optical radiation that passes from the optical emitter to the optical sensor correlates to the position of the interrupter pin therebetween and the amount of optical radiation that the interrupter pin permits to pass from the optical emitter to the optical sensor. The amount of optical radiation is senses by the optical sensor. The amount of radiation sensed by the radiation sensor is correlated to the position of the interrupter pin. 
 The interrupter pin is connected to an object, the position of which is to be measured. Movement of the object causes movement of the interrupter pin between the optical emitter and the optical sensor to result in detection of an amount of optical radiation that correlates with the position of the object to be measured. For example, the object may be a diaphragm whereby distance of travel of the diaphragm corresponds to amount of pressure placed on the diaphragm. Therefore, the amount of optical radiation sensed by the optical sensor correlates directly to pressure on the diaphragm. As a result, pressure can be sensed by using the method of measuring distance of the present invention.

" The present invention provides an apparatus and a method for scanning communication channels, such as an intelligent Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) channels, for determining availability for receiving and transmitting communication signals. A mobile terminal, for example, using the method and/or system disclosed, scans an optimized channel in a WCDMA network, which results in increased communication efficiency. 
 In one aspect, the communication channels are scanned according to priority established by an occupation number of the channel. The occupation number refers to the number of signals utilizing the channel. In another aspect, the communication channels are scanned according to priority established by a frequency ranking of selected channel. 
 In yet another aspect, an apparatus scans an intelligent WCDMA channel, including a baseband unit, a table unit, a control unit, and a radio frequency unit. The baseband unit processes baseband signals transmitted or received by a mobile terminal. The table unit provides a table of all channels allocated to a WCDMA system, and records and stores occupation numbers of each channel. The control unit scans the channel having a highest occupation number stored as data in the table unit, and selects a communication channel according to priority. The control unit selects the radio frequency unit for transmitting or receiving communication signals through the channel. 
 In another aspect, a method for scanning an intelligent WCDMA channel includes: selecting a frequency group having highest priority, scanning sequentially channels which composes the frequency group according to priority, deciding whether and when an channel that is available exists in the frequency group, and performing communication through the channel. 
 In another aspect, the table unit forms the frequency group by arranging the allocated channels into 5 MHz intervals, accumulating and storing the occupation numbers of each channel, and storing an updated priority of the frequency group. 
 In another aspect, the control unit receives the data from the table unit, selects the frequency group having priority that is the highest, and scans the channels of the selected frequency group according to the priority. The control unit confirms an occupation state of the scanned channel, occupies, registers the channel with, for example, a base station for use when available, and transmits and/or receives communication signals through the channel upon receiving a data communication request, for example, by a user. 
 In yet another aspect, priority is determined by accumulating and storing an occupation number for each of the channels. The priority of a frequency group is stored according to the occupation number. The occupation numbers are accumulated for each channel. When the accumulation of occupation numbers reaches a predetermined upper limit value, the occupation numbers are reduced at a predetermined ratio and the priority of the channels is updated. 
 The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. 
 It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description of the present invention are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.

" The present invention relates to a metallization structure for semiconductor device interconnects comprising a substrate having a substantially planar upper surface, a metal layer disposed on a portion of the substrate upper surface, a conducting layer overlying the metal layer, and metal spacers flanking the sidewalls of the conducting layer and the underlying metal layer. The metal layer and metal spacers do not encapsulate the conducting layer. The substrate upper surface is preferably a dielectric layer. The conducting layer preferably comprises aluminum or an aluminum-copper alloy, but may also comprise copper. When the conducting layer comprises Al, the metal layer and metal spacer preferably comprise titanium, such as Ti or TiN. An optional dielectric layer, preferably silicon oxide, may be disposed on the conducting layer. When the optional dielectric layer is present, the metal spacer extends along the sidewall of the dielectric layer. 
 The present invention also relates to a metallization structure comprising a substrate having a metal layer disposed thereon, a dielectric layer having an aperture therethrough disposed on the substrate so the bottom of the aperture exposes the upper surface of the metal layer, at least one metal spacer on the sidewall of the aperture, and a conducting layer filling the remaining portion of the aperture. The metal layer and metal spacer preferably comprise titanium, such as Ti or TiN. At least one upper metal layer may be disposed on the conducting layer. 
 The present invention further relates to a method for making a metallization structure by forming a substantially planar first dielectric layer on a substrate, forming a metal layer over the first dielectric layer, forming a conducting layer over the metal layer, forming a second dielectric layer over the conducting layer, removing a portion of the second dielectric layer, conducting layer, and metal layer to form a multi-layer structure, and forming metal spacers on the sidewalls of the multi-layer structure. The process optionally removes both the second dielectric layer portion of the multi-layer structure and the laterally adjacent portions of the metal spacers. 
 The present invention additionally relates to a method for making a metallization structure by forming a substrate comprising a metal layer disposed thereon, forming a dielectric layer comprising an aperture on the substrate so the bottom of the aperture exposes the upper surface of the metal layer, forming a metal spacer on the sidewall (in the case of a via) or sidewalls (in the case of a trench) of the aperture, and forming a conducting layer in the remaining portion of the aperture. At least one upper metal layer may optionally be formed on the conducting layer. 
 The present invention also relates to a method for making a metallization structure by forming a substrate comprising a metal layer on the surface thereof, forming on the substrate a dielectric layer comprising an aperture so the bottom of the aperture exposes the surface of the metal layer, forming a conducting layer in the aperture, forming an upper metal layer overlying the dielectric layer and the aperture, removing the portions of the upper metal layer overlying the dielectric layer, removing the dielectric layer, removing the portions of the metal layer not underlying the aperture to form a multi-layer metal structure, and forming a metal spacer on the sidewall or sidewalls of the multi-layer metal structure. 
 The present invention provides several advantages when compared to the prior art. One advantage is that thermally induced stress voids are reduced because the metal layer and metal spacer comprise materials exhibiting good thermal-voiding avoidance characteristics. Another advantage is that the size of conductive lines can be shrunk further in comparison to dimensions achievable by conventional processes, since only one additional deposition and etch step, without an additional masking step, is needed to form the metallization structure. Shrinking of conductive lines is necessary as device geometries decrease to less than 0.1 μm. At these small geometries, even small notches can significantly decrease conductivity. 
 The invention also specifically includes semiconductor devices including the inventive metallization structures.

forming a substrate comprising at least one metal layer on a surface thereof; 
forming a dielectric layer over the at least one metal layer;

forming a metal spacer completely flanking the at least one sidewall of the aperture and contacting the least one metal layer; and 
forming a conductive layer in a remaining portion of the aperture such that at least a bottom surface of the conductive layer contacts a portion of the at least one metal layer."
" It is an object of the invention to provide a hydraulic bearing having acoustic decoupling with the acoustic decoupling being matched to a specific resonance frequency (hum frequency). 
 The hydraulic bearing of the invention includes: a pot-shaped housing containing a hydraulic volume; a support spring disposed in the pot-shaped housing and being made of elastomeric material; a compensating membrane disposed in the housing; the support spring being arranged in the pot-shaped housing so as to cause the support spring to close off the hydraulic volume from above and the compensating membrane being arranged in the pot-shaped housing so as to cause the compensating membrane to close off the hydraulic volume from below; a partition wall for partitioning the hydraulic volume into a work chamber and a compensating chamber; a transfer channel disposed in the partition wall for interconnecting the chambers; the partition wall defining an opening; a radially prestressed membrane-like decoupling element fixed in the opening and being made of flexible elastic material; the decoupling element being laterally clamped so as to be pressure tight; a lattice base plate and a lattice throttle plate disposed in the housing; and, the decoupling element being between the plates which act to limit displacement of the decoupling element. 
 The advantages of the invention are found in the very substantial avoidance of the problems set forth above. 
 The radial prestressing of the decoupling element is so selected that its natural frequency lies in the range of the hum frequency to be reduced. The disturbance noise transmission from motor to chassis is substantially suppressed because of the dynamic stiffness lowering in the critical rpm range. 
 The decoupling element includes a reinforcing insert, preferably with a peripheral bead. 
 The use of raw rubber in the manufacture of the decoupling membrane provides the wanted prestress already as a consequence of the vulcanization process. In addition to prestressing, the natural frequency of the decoupling element is influenced by the parameters: length expansion, width expansion and shore hardness. If the decoupling membrane is not circular, but the length and width deviate from each other, then different natural frequencies result because of this whereby a certain bandwidth of the stiffness reduction results. The frequency response can be additionally influenced with the aid of transverse struts integrated into the decoupling membrane.

" A plurality of semiconductor lasers are typically formed on a semiconductor substrate in a wafer condition. However, it may occur at times that a distance of two mutually adjacent semiconductors on the wafer is in agreement with a distance between two nozzles on the inkjet device. In such a case, it is not possible to eject a micro lens material from a plurality of nozzles during a period of time in which a head makes one relative movement.

Consequently, even if the distance in the x-direction between the mutually adjacent sections subject to ejection should change per substrate, the material may be ejected to the plurality of sections subject to ejection during a one-time period of scanning. Further, since there is no need to alter the angle of attaching the head per substrate, it is easily applicable to multiple use of substrates. 
 Preferably, the step (A) can include a step of placing the substrate on a stage and a step of positioning the substrate relative to the plurality of nozzles by rotating the stage. According to the above-mentioned characteristics, since the stage rotates with the substrate, the substrate positioning is made easy. 
 Further preferably, the step (A) can include further a step of putting the x-coordinates of the two nozzles and the x-coordinates of the two sections subject to ejection in agreement. 
 As mentioned above, since that the distance in the x-axis direction between the mutually adjacent sections subject to ejection and a gap between any two nozzles of the plurality of nozzles arranged in the x-axis direction may be in agreement, it is possible to eject the material from the plurality of nozzles to the plurality of sections subject to ejection so that a micro lens may be formed efficiently. 
 Further, aspects of the invention can make it possible to realize a variety of embodiments and may be realized as embodiments, such as a lens manufacturing method and a semiconductor laser fabrication method.

 According to the above-mentioned characteristics, the scanner rotates the stage so that the distance in the x-axis direction between the mutually adjacent sections subject to ejection and the gap between any two nozzles of the plurality of nozzles may be in agreement. Consequently, the material may be ejected to the plurality of sections subject to ejection during a one-time period of scanning. Also, even if the distance in the x-direction between the mutually adjacent sections subject to ejection should change per substrate, there is no need to alter the angle of attaching the head per substrate, hence, it is easily applicable to multiple use of substrates

It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a technology for controlling a polishing amount of CMP in a device isolating process with satisfactory accuracy regardless of the ratio between the area of each of device forming regions and that of each of trench regions, the type of abrasive, etc. 
 A remaining film thickness determining method employed in a polishing process, according to a first invention comprises:

 a fifth step for polishing the surface of the buried insulating film so as to expose the surface of the coated film; and 
 a sixth step for measuring remaining film thicknesses of the coated film subsequent to the fifth step, at a plurality of measuring points; and 


 a computing process including, 
        
 a seventh step for conceptually defining reference regions each having a predetermined shape and area in the surface of the semiconductor substrate such that each of the measuring points is placed in the center thereof;

 a seventh step for polishing the buried insulating film and the polish suppressing films such that the surface of the coated film is exposed. 




 According to the first invention, reference regions each having a predetermined shape and area can be defined. The remaining film thickness can be determined using the ratio between the area of the reference region and the gross area of lines. Thus, since the remaining film thickness is determined plus an area ratio of regions around measuring pads in addition to layout positions (i.e., points to be determined) of the measuring pads, an accurate judgement on the remaining film thickness is enabled. 
 According to the second invention, since polish suppressing films are formed in a region in which the result of determination of the remaining film thickness in a polishing process is smaller than a predetermined film thickness, the remaining film thickness of a coated film can be highly accurately controlled by mere addition of a simple process.

" An advantage of the invention is that it permits zero ohm resistors to be replaced with soldered shunts. The soldered shunts are formed by first printing shunt pads onto the board along with the other printed circuitry. Then, during the soldering process for mounting components, a bridge is formed across the shunt pads. 
 Thus, the shunt pads are formed during the manufacture of the board itself. The bridges across the shunts are formed during the normal soldering process. The “pick and place” steps required for zero ohm resistors are replaced with a simple soldering step. This eliminates the cost of the resistor components and reduces assembly time for the board. 
 The use of shunt pads makes it easy to accomplish hardware customization after a board is printed. If the shunt pads are in place, there are three choices for that location on the board: the shunt pads may be left as is for no interconnection, the shunt pads may be soldered for a zero ohm interconnection, or the shunt pads may be used as solder points for a non zero ohm resistor.

The acid produced, preferably a relatively dilute sulfuric acid solution, advantageously can be used in other metal extraction processes often with significant cost savings. 
 As will be described in greater detail hereinbelow, the methods and processes of the present invention are particularly suited for use in connection with sulfur-bearing materials comprising residues from pressure leaching operations, such as, for example, those operated at medium temperatures (e.g., about 140° to about 180° C.).

" A multi-scale finite-volume (MSFV) approach is taught for solving elliptic or parabolic problems such as those found in subsurface flow simulators. Advantages of the present MSFV method are that it fits nicely into a finite-volume framework, it allows for computing effective coarse-scale transmissibilities, treats tensor permeabilities properly, and is conservative at both the coarse and fine-scales. The present method is computationally efficient relative to reservoir simulation now in use and is well suited for massive parallel computation. The present invention can be applied to 3D unstructured grids and also to multi-phase flow. Further, the reconstructed fine-scale solution satisfies the proper mass balance on the fine-scale. 
 A multi-scale approach is described which results in effective transmissibilities for the coarse-scale problem. Once the transmissibilities are constructed, the MSFV method uses a finite-volume scheme employing multi-point stencils for flux discretization. The approach is conservative and treats tensor permeabilities correctly. This method is easily applied using existing finite-volume codes, and once the transmissibilities are computed, the method is computationally very efficient. In computing the effective transmissibilities, closure assumptions are employed. 
 A significant characteristic of the present multi-scale method is that two sets of basis functions are employed. A first set of dual basis functions is computed to construct transmissibilities between coarse cells. A second set of locally computed fine-scale basis functions is utilized to reconstruct a fine-scale velocity field from a coarse scale solution. This second set of fine-scale basis functions is designed such that the reconstructed fine-scale velocity solution is fully consistent with the transmissibilities. Further, the solution satisfies the proper mass balance on the small scale. 
 The MSFV method may be used in modeling a subsurface reservoir. A fine grid is first created defining a plurality of fine cells. A permeability field and other fine-scale properties are associated with the fine cells. Next, a coarse grid is created which defines a plurality of coarse cells having interfaces between the coarse cells. The coarse cells are ideally aggregates of the fine cells. A dual coarse grid is constructed defining a plurality of dual coarse control volumes. The dual coarse control volumes are ideally also aggregates of the fine cells. Boundaries surround the dual coarse control volumes. 
 Dual basis functions are then calculated on the dual coarse control volumes by solving local elliptic or parabolic problems, preferably using boundary conditions obtained from solving reduced problems along the interfaces of the course cells. Fluxes, preferably integral fluxes, are then extracted across the interfaces of the coarse cells from the dual basis functions. These fluxes are assembled to obtain effective transmissibilities between coarse cells of the coarse cell grid. The transmissibilities can be used for coarse scale finite volume calculations. 
 A fine-scale velocity field may be established. A finite volume method is used to calculate pressures in the coarse cells utilizing the transmissibilities between cells. Fine-scale basis functions are computed by solving local elliptic or parabolic flow problems on the coarse cells and by utilizing fine-scale fluxes across the interfaces of the coarse cells which are extracted from the dual basis functions. Finally, the fine-scale basis functions and the corresponding coarse cell pressures are combined to extract the fine-scale velocity field. 
 A transport problem may be solved on the fine grid by using the fine-scale velocity field. Ideally, the transport problem is solved iteratively in two stages. In the first stage, a fine-scale velocity field is obtained from solving a pressure equation. In the second stage, the transport problem is solved on the fine cells using the fine-scale velocity field. A Schwartz overlap technique can be applied to solve the transport problem locally on each coarse cell with an implicit upwind scheme. 
 A solution may be computed on the coarse cells at an incremental time and properties, such as a mobility coefficient, may be generated for the fine cells at the incremental time. If a predetermined condition is not met for all fine cells inside a dual coarse control volume, then the dual and fine-scale basis functions in that dual coarse control volume are reconstructed.

" The current invention presents a method and a device and a computer program product for managing media items in mobile terminals. Particularly the current invention focuses on arranging, viewing and querying media items organized in hierarchical multidimensional clusters in mobile terminals, which overcome user interface constraints for metadata-assisted media query in mobile terminals. The invention presents a method for multidimensional clustering and for querying the media items from said clusters and for automatically selecting the depth of cluster hierarchy. The present invention also provides a user interface with a query mechanism to be used with clusters. 
 Due to the invention the media items are provided with descriptive information, a dimension, wherein the media items that have one descriptive information in common are clustered together. The descriptive information is configured as metadata which can be inserted to media item file manually by the user or automatically. One example of suitable descriptive information is location and time, whereupon the cluster contains media items acquired in a certain place at a certain time. 
 The cluster comprising the collection of media items is shown to the user. The user interface according to the invention is arranged so that one cluster is shown as a single item among other individual items in the user interface. When the user selects the cluster, another view is opened and the items of that cluster are shown to the user. 
 The benefit of the clustering is that a list of media items being shown to the user is shorter than in the prior art solution (where all the items are shown in one list), which mitigates the limited display capabilities of mobile terminals. The clustering also helps for collecting media items being somehow linked depending on the descriptive information, logically to the same view. It also offers enough information for the user to quickly see the content of the cluster. Cluster naming facilitates organizing the clusters and the media items to the media collections. 
 A media manager according to the invention is available anytime and anywhere, when implemented in a mobile terminal. The specific user interface takes into account the limitations of display capabilities of a mobile terminal and reduces them. The media manager also enables the end-users to construct complex queries only with a limited “point-and-click”, which further creates a chance for automatic adaptation of media query based on the user's previous query behavior and thus reducing the end-users' query formation effort in subsequent query formation situations. 
 The preferred embodiments of the invention are set forth in the drawings, in the detailed description which follows, and in the appended claims. Further objects and advantages of the invention are also considered in the description. The invention itself is defined with particularity in the claims.

" This invention relates to an air cleaning apparatus having a pollution-collecting chamber, a container of water, and a rotatable elongated perforated tubular member having a lower and disposed in the water such that as the tubular member is rotated, the water is drawn up into the tube and out through the perforations to form a rain-like spray in the path of motion of air in the chamber. 
 Many air filtration devices, such as vacuum cleaners and the like, have a housing with a motor for passing air through the housing and one or more filters. In some cases the prior art devices use a water bath filter in which the unfiltered air is passed through the water to remove pollutants from the air. 
 The broad purpose of the present invention is to provide an improved air filtration apparatus and aromatizer having relatively few components, as well as a novel way for forming a water mist for collecting pollutants from the air. 
 The preferred embodiment of the invention comprises a frusto-conical housing having a motor at its upper, narrow end and a container of water at its base. A pollution-collecting chamber is disposed between the motor and the container of water. The unfiltered air is passed drawn into the chamber through a pair of tubes to impact on the surface of water, which functions as an initial filter. 
 The motor is connected to the upper end of an elongated tube. The tube has a lower end disposed in the water. The curvature of the tube is such that as the tube is rotated by the motor, the lower tube end draws water up into the mid-section of the tube where it then issues through perforations in the tube into the pollution-collecting chamber as a mist. The mist is disposed in the path of motion of air in the pollution-collecting chamber. The mist removes further pollutants from the water and passes the filtered air upwardly where it then passes through a H.E.P.A. and charcoal filter. A lazy susan support carries aromatic products to aromatize the filtered air.

" It is therefore an object of the invention to provide fuel cell separators which have a high hydrophilicity and are thus capable of easily removing water that forms as a result of power generation by the fuel cell, and which have a low contact resistance with electrodes in the fuel cell. 
 We have discovered that, in fuel cell separators made by shaping a composition containing a thermosetting resin, an artificial graphite and an internal mold release agent, by using an artificial graphite having an average particle size within a specific range and by setting the average surface roughness Ra of the separator within a specific range, the hydrophilicity of the separator can be increased, enabling the easy removal of water that forms as a result of power generation by the fuel cell, in addition to which the contact resistance with electrodes in the fuel cell can be minimized. 
 Accordingly, the invention provides a fuel cell separator which is made by shaping a composition that includes a thermosetting resin, an artificial graphite with an average particle size of 20 to 70 μm and an internal mold release agent, and which has a surface with an average roughness Ra of 1.0 to 5.0 μm. 
 The fuel cell separator typically contains 10 to 30 parts by weight of the thermosetting resin and 0.1 to 1.5 parts by weight of the internal mold release agent per 100 parts by weight of the artificial graphite. The artificial graphite is preferably obtained by firing needle coke at 2,000 to 3,000° C. 
 In the fuel cell separator of the invention, the surface generally has an average spacing between peaks Sm of 100 to 200 μm. Moreover, the surface typically is a gas flow channel face which is preferably obtained by surface treatment with an alumina abrasive grain having a grit size of 150 to 320 and which has a wetting tension of preferably 40 to 70 mN/m. 
 In the inventive fuel cell separator, it is desirable for the surface to be a surface of contact between the fuel cell separator and an electrode. The surface of contact between the fuel cell separator and an electrode is preferably obtained by surface treatment with an alumina abrasive grain having a grit size of 150 to 320. 
 Because it is made by shaping a composition that includes a thermosetting resin, an artificial graphite having an average particle size of 20 to 70 μm and an internal mold release agent, and because it has a surface with an average roughness Ra of 1.0 to 5.0 μm, the fuel cell separator of the invention is endowed with a high hydrophilicity which enables the easy removal of water that has formed as a result of power generation by the fuel cell, in addition to which contact resistance is minimized. Fuel cells provided with the fuel cell separators of the invention are thus capable of maintaining a stable power generating efficiency over an extended period of time.

" An object of the present invention is to provide an actuator device, a safety mechanism for a motor vehicle, and an associated process for checking the operability of an actuator of an actuator device, to ensure secure triggering of the safety mechanism. 
 A basic aspect of the present invention is to operate or actuate an actuator of the actuator device to check its operability without triggering the safety mechanism. In this way, a check can be made to ensure that the actuator for releasing the safety mechanism actually functions. Accordingly, this increases reliability, and thus, safety in the event of an accident, since an essential functioning of the safety mechanism can be verified. 
 The actuator of the present invention is preferably operated during a function test counter to the direction of trigger and then is reset to its start position by means of a resilient force. This allows a very simple implementation that provides increased safety and reliability. 
 The function test is preferably carried out regularly and automatically. If the function test fails, repairs can be immediately made to the actuator device, so that the breakdown probability, in the event of an actual accident, at least is substantially reduced. 
 Further advantages, characteristics, properties and aspects of the present invention will emerge from the following description of a preferred embodiment with reference to the accompanying drawings.

" By contrast, the present invention provides a closed-loop excitation system that is continuously tuned to the resonant frequency of the flexible wing structure. The invention represents a fundamental basis for the control of a resonating wing structure that would compose the flight apparatus of an agile ornithoptic MAV. The concept has been developed and demonstrated using a benchtop laboratory apparatus. 
 The key feature of the problem addressed by this invention is the operation of the flapping wing mechanism at the resonant frequency of the fundamental structural mode of the flexible wing-and-actuator system. This is the frequency at which the actuation energy that is provided to the system is most efficiently converted to mechanical displacement of the wing structure; i.e.: the amplitude of vibration of the flexible wing structure will be maximized when periodic excitation of the structure is provided at the resonant frequency. 
 In order to accomplish this objective, a piezoelectric strain rate sensor is attached to the flexible wing structure. An actuator system is provided to excite vibration of the wings. Excitation of the wings causes a periodic vibratory signal to be emitted from the sensor. The sensor's periodic signal is fed through a software algorithm, which converts the signal to a square wave of the same frequency. The resulting square wave is amplified and fed back through the actuator to drive the flexible wing structure at the frequency and amplitude provided by the square wave input. After a very few cycles, the closed-loop, iterative process causes the system to tune itself to resonance, thereby driving the flexible wing structure at its resonant frequency, at which the system operates most efficiently.

A tuning circuit for enabling the excitation of a flexible structure at its resonant frequency, comprising a strain rate sensor configured for attachment to the flexible structure and capable of producing a feedback signal in response to the excitation of the flexible structure, a tuning algorithm capable of converting the feedback signal to a desired periodic waveform, and a first actuator capable of receiving the converted waveform and configured for exciting an oscillatory vibration of the flexible structure."

" The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of one or more aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention, and is neither intended to identify key or critical elements of the invention, nor to delineate the scope thereof. Rather, the primary purpose of the summary is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later. 
 The present invention facilitates further improving device performance by improving channel mobility. Failure to improve mobility can prevent and/or limit future shrinkage/scaling of devices. The present invention deposits a composite nitride cap prior to performing an activation annealing process in order to improve channel mobility, through a different physical mechanism from the strain enhanced mobility mechanism described in the prior art. 
 Specifically, the present invention employs a cap-annealing process that improves electron channel mobility. The process uses a nitride composite cap to alter the active dopant profile across the channel regions. During an annealing process, dopants (e.g. boron) migrate from the Si/SiO2 interface in a channel region into silicon oxide that is over the source/drain extension and source/drain area, thereby altering the dopant profile of the channel region. This altered profile generally improves channel mobility thereby improving device performance and permitting smaller density designs. 
 To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the invention comprises the features hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims. The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative aspects and implementations of the invention. These are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the invention may be employed. Other objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the drawings.

" In consideration of the above disadvantages, it is an object of the present invention to provide a new technique capable of setting an automatic gain control loop which can follow fading pitches having different periods with a relatively simple configuration. 
 The present invention provides an automatic gain control method for a radio communication mobile station, the method including the steps of: measuring a fading pitch on the basis of the power of a signal received by the radio communication mobile station; and changing averaging time required to calculate average received power used in automatic gain control depending on the fading pitch. 
 According to the method of the present invention, a fading pitch is measured on the basis of the power of a received signal, and averaging time required to calculate average received power used in controlling an AGC amplifier is changed. When the received signal power changes very strongly, namely, the fading pitch is high, the gain control of the AGC amplifier is performed at a high rate, thus allowing the gain control of the AGC amplifier to follow the change in received power due to fast fading. Consequently, the amplitudes of I-component and Q-component baseband signals obtained by orthogonal demodulation can be kept constant, thus preventing a degradation in receiver sensitivity. 
 The present invention further provides a radio communication mobile station having a fading pitch measuring device for measuring the fading pitch of a received signal. When the fading pitch is high, averaging time required to calculate average received power used to obtain an AGC signal is reduced, thus allowing the gain control of an AGC amplifier to follow a steep change in received signal power due to fast fading so that the amplitudes of I-component and Q-component baseband signals to be supplied to a baseband signal processor are always kept constant. 
 More particularly, the present invention provides a radio communication mobile station including: an antenna for receiving a signal transmitted from a base station; a receiver for converting the received signal having a radio frequency bandwidth into an intermediate frequency signal; an AGC amplifier for amplifying the intermediate frequency signal; an orthogonal demodulator for performing orthogonal demodulation and frequency conversion to the intermediate frequency signal generated from the AGC amplifier to produce I-component and Q-component baseband signals; AD converters for converting the I-component and Q-component baseband signals, that are analog, generated from the orthogonal demodulator into digital signals, respectively; a baseband signal processor for processing the digital signals generated from the AD converters; an instantaneous received power calculator for calculating instantaneous power from the digital signals generated from the AD converters; a fading pitch measuring device for measuring a fading pitch based on the instantaneous power calculated by the instantaneous received power calculator; an average received power calculator, which receives the instantaneous power calculated by the instantaneous received power calculator and information related to the fading pitch measured by the fading pitch measuring device, for calculating average received power from the instantaneous power calculated by the instantaneous received power calculator according to averaging time set depending on the fading pitch information; and a feedback AGC code generator for calculating a signal to control the gain of the AGC amplifier so as to offset the difference between reference power and the average received power calculated by the average received power calculator and then feeding back the signal as an AGC signal to the AGC amplifier. 
 According to the method of the present invention, the fading pitch of a received signal is measured, and the measured fading pitch is compared to a reference value. If the measured fading pitch is higher than the reference value, averaging time required to calculate average received power is reduced. Even when the power of a received signal steeply changes due to fast fading, the gain control of an AGC amplifier can follow the steep change in received power, so that the respective amplitudes of I-component and Q-component baseband signals to be supplied to a baseband signal processor can always be kept constant. A degradation in receiver sensitivity can be prevented.
","1. An automatic gain control method for a radio communication mobile station, the method comprising the steps of:

" In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a tieback connector for attaching a riser string to a subsea production assembly. The tieback connector includes a main body adapted to be coupled to the subsea production assembly. As used herein, the terms “couple,” “couples,” “coupled” or the like, are intended to mean either indirect or direct connection. Thus, if a first device “couples” to a second device, that connection may be through a direct connection or through an indirect connection via other devices or connectors. The main body of the tieback connector has a central passageway sufficiently large to pass an end of the riser string therein. The tieback connector also includes a connector positioner coupled to the main body on an inner surface thereof, which is adapted to secure the tieback connector around a circumferential surface of a wellhead of the subsea production assembly. In one embodiment, the main body is adapted to be coupled to the subsea production assembly subsea by an ROV. In another embodiment, the main body is adapted to be coupled to the subsea production assembly at the surface. In yet another embodiment, the main body is adapted to be coupled to the end of the riser string. 
 In one embodiment, the tieback connector may also include an extension portion coupled to the tieback connector. The extension portion has a profile adapted to correct any misalignment of an end of the riser string (riser terminus) during landing of the riser string on the subsea production assembly. The profile of the extension portion has a generally cylindrical shape which is tapered along its length from a top end, which is defined by a generally funnel-shaped opening, to a bottom end which couples to the main body. Furthermore, the extension portion may be formed with an inwardly projecting rib formed adjacent to the funnel-shaped opening. 
 In one embodiment, the tieback connector further includes an intermediate actuator ring disposed within the main body and an inner latching ring disposed within the intermediate actuator ring; the inner latching ring having upper and lower grooves adapted to engage a wellhead of the subsea production assembly. The intermediate actuator ring and inner latching ring have cooperating tapered surfaces which enable generally axial or vertical movement of the actuator ring to translate into generally radial or transverse movement of the inner latching ring. The tieback connector may further include a hydraulic pressure valve coupled to the main body, which when activated supplies pressurized fluid to a sealed chamber disposed between the intermediate actuator ring and an inner wall of the main body. The pressurized fluid forces the intermediate actuator ring to move generally vertically (axially), which in turn causes the inner latching ring to move generally radially (transversely) into engagement with the wellhead. As those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, however, mechanical means can be used to accomplish the movement of the intermediate actuator ring relative to the inner latching ring. 
 In one embodiment, the connector positioner includes a single ring-shaped band having opposed flanges, which fits around the circumferential surface of the wellhead. In another embodiment, the connector positioner comprises a pair of yokes each having a pair of flanged ends, which are arranged around the circumferential surface of the wellhead such that the flanged ends face each other. The connector positioner may further include one or more hydraulic cylinders or mechanically operated cylinders which operate to tighten the connector positioner around the circumferential surface of the wellhead. 
 The present invention has a number of advantages. One such advantage is that the connector installation is off the critical path of operations of the production platform. As such, the operation becomes cheaper. Another advantage is that in the event the connector fails to latch properly, it can be replaced without having to break and re-make the entire riser string. The consequences and cost of risk are thereby much reduced. Furthermore, the size of the passage through the air-cans can be minimized. Other advantages include: a single element connecting the wellhead and riser terminus; a single leak tight joint between the wellhead and riser terminus; a single high-load mechanism for effecting the connection; connection mechanisms, and their parts, need not be designed and built for the demands of a smaller overall diameter; existing, proven latching/connecting elements can be used; and the load capacity is not reduced such as would be true if the connector were constrained to a small overall diameter.

" U.S. Pat. No. 4,019,887 to Kirkbride et al. discloses the coating of glass with a layer of silicon or a silica complex by continuous chemical treatment of a hot glass substrate with a non-oxidizing gas containing a monosilane. Inclusion of ethylene in the non-oxidizing gas of the Kirkbride et al. process to improve resistance of the silica complex layer to attack by alkali compounds is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,188,444 to Landau. 
 A method of pyrolytically forming a silica-containing coating on a glass substrate at an elevated temperature is found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,142. U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,142 is hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth in its entirety herein. In this patent, silane, oxygen, a radical scavenger gas and a carrier gas are combined as a precursor mixture, and the precursor is directed toward and along the surface of the heated glass substrate. The presence of the radical scavenger allows the silane, which is pyrophoric, to be premixed with the oxygen without undergoing ignition and premature reaction at the operating temperatures. The radical scavenger further provides control of and permits optimization of the kinetics of the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reaction on the glass. A preferred combination of precursor materials includes monosilane and oxygen, with ethylene as the radical scavenger, and includes nitrogen or helium as a carrier gas. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,210 discloses a method of forming reflective layers on glass. This reference discusses the use of silane in addition to ammonia or an amine to form a silicon/nitrogen coating on a glass sheet. U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,210 does not disclose the use of oxygen in the reaction. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 6,444,588 discloses the use of an oxygen containing precursor, a silicon containing precursor and a nitrogen containing precursor in the formation of an anti-reflective coating on a glass substrate used in a printed circuit. The reactants are combined in a plasma electric CVD process to form an anti-reflective coating. 
 Known processes for the production of silica layers on a substrate through CVD processes are limited in the thickness or efficiency of the deposition process, and also by powder formation (pre-reaction) of the reactive elements. Therefore, it is desired to devise an improved process for the formation of silica layers on a substrate. 
","1. A process for depositing a silica coating upon a heated glass substrate comprising the steps of:

 According to an aspect of the present invention, a developer driving device, including a photosensitive drum driving gear installed on a flange on a photosensitive drum axis on one side of a photosensitive drum is provided. The photosensitive drum is rotated by a main motor located in a main body frame. The developer driving device also includes an intermediary gear installed to be able to perform a no-load operation on the flange, which rotates a developing roller driving gear by being connected to a sub motor in the main body frame.

" The present invention comprises a system for transporting compressed gas aboard a ship, the system comprising: a) tanks aboard the ship adapted for carrying the compressed gas; b) a zeolite material in each of the tanks, the zeolite material adapted for adsorption of the gas into pore spaces of the zeolite material; and c) connection means for connecting the tanks to sources for receiving and dispensing the gas. 
 The present invention also comprises a method for transportation of natural gas aboard a ship, the method comprising the steps of: 
 a. providing a plurality of tanks on board the ship; 
 b. putting a zeolite material in the tanks; 
 c. connecting gas delivery tubes to the tanks; 
 d. introducing the gas into the tanks under pressure until a desired pressure is reached; 
 e. disconnecting the gas delivery tubes to the tanks, and allowing the ship to embark to its desired destination; and 
 f. after the ship reaches its desired destination, connecting gas delivery tubes to the tanks, and discharging the gas from the tanks. 
 An advantage of the present invention is that it utilizes the adsorption properties of zeolite material to increase the capacity for storing gas on board a ship, and decrease the pressure required to store the gas. Clathrates, also known as gas or methane hydrates, may also be used for this purpose. 
 Other advantageous features of the present invention are that the zeolite material is benign, non-toxic, abundant, inexpensive, easily adsorbing under pressure and, when depressurized, easily release methane and other hydrocarbon gases at controllable flow rates. Important safety advantages of transporting compressed gases adsorbed into zeolite material include lower storage pressures and much slower release of gas if the storage vessel is accidentally ruptured, as more fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,619,225, incorporated into this patent by this reference. The lower pressure required for adsorptive storage of natural gas in zeolite material allows lighter, less expensive gas cargo tanks to be employed than those required for highly compressed natural gas. Because zeolites are highly porous, after initial high pressure required for complete saturation with natural gas, subsequent maintenance is at a relatively low pressure and high-volume capacity. This feature considerably reduces the costs of ship design, construction, and operation. 
 Although the volumetric ratio of gas, particularly as liquefied natural gas (LNG), gas-to-liquid (GTL), and compressed natural gas (CNG) technologies, is higher than in the present invention, the present invention has the advantages of loading and unloading simplicity, and almost hazardless storage and shipment of gas in containers filled with inexpensive zeolite material.

" My invention, the half-round total internal reflection magnifying prism, called TIR mag prism in short form, has the objective of modifying the path of light without loss of energy or brightness due to reflection from a mirrored surface nor from the partial reflection that occurs at every refractive interface. In particular, it transforms a virtual image at one end of the prism into a virtual image of a different size at the other end of the prism. Being potentially made of a single unbroken piece of transparent material, such as glass or plastic, it may be more practically manufactured and employed for this purpose then magnifying optical systems made of several lenses or mirrors, in addition to being more efficient due to having only total internal reflection faces. 
 The basic operation on the light the TIR mag prism performs is the same as that performed by a telescope. Thus the TIR mag prism can potentially be used as a telescope, to form a magnified image of a distant object. More generally it could potentially be used in opto-electronic devices as a miniature one-piece optical pickup. Moreover, the basic function can also be used to collect a signal or power into a a smaller channel. Since the TIR mag prism has no lossy medium-to-air interfaces, it may be very usefully employed for coupling optical fibres carrying signals or power. Additionally, since the TIR mag prism has no entry face and no exit face, it may be ideal for manufacture in mosaic form similar to lens arrays for the purpose of concentrating solar power. Since light can move through any lens or prism in both directions, the TIR mag prism can also be used to diffuse or demagnify light if light is fed into the smaller end. 
 A further advantage of the TIR mag prism is that it has a light path free of central obstructions. All economically feasible reflecting telescopes have a so-called central obstruction which holds the secondary mirror. This obstruction slightly decreases the light-gathering power of the telescope and decreases its resolution due to the diffraction of light around this central obstruction. It is an interesting feature of the TIR mag prism that it has no such central obstruction. Since in some emodiments it has no metallic surfaces, it imparts no frequency specific transmission bias due to the properties of the metal. This may make it an optically useful astronomical telescope; it may also allow it to be used for microscopic applications such as light-sensing in consumer electronics or other sensometric applications. 
 An additional advantage is that it is an optical system designed to rely on low angles of incidence, or glancing angles. It thus may function with very high-frequency electromagnetic radiation, such as X-ray radiation, which is technically above the frequency of human vision but still a province of geometric optics in general. For example, the Chandra X-ray Observatory uses a glancing metal mirror to focus X-rays (since X-rays only reflect off metal at very low angles). Further objects and advantages will become apparent from a a consideration of the drawings and ensuing description.

" The invention, in part, provides a method of forming a semiconductor device having at least one high-voltage and low-voltage transistor on a single substrate that overcomes the above-noted deficiencies. In the method, reliability of the high-voltage transistor is enhanced by doping the high-voltage transistor with an LDD implantation process to form LDD regions thereon before conducting the oxidation processes to protect the substrate and gate electrode. After the oxidation process step is performed, then the low-voltage transistor is doped with the LDD implantation process. The resultant device provides a high-voltage transistor where the subsequent oxidation step provides a deep LDD region junction depth to ensure reliability, and provides a low-voltage transistor that is LDD-doped after the oxidation step to provide a shallower LDD region junction depth so as to maintain short channel effect immunity. 
 The invention, in part, pertains to each transistor including a gate insulating film, source/drain regions and a channel located directly under the gate electrode. The gate insulating film of the transistor having the higher operation voltage is thicker than the gate insulating film of the transistor having the lower operation voltage. Each transistor includes an LDD region subject to the LDD implantation, the oxidation process causing thermal diffusion of the LDD regions in the transistor having a higher threshold voltage so that a junction depth of the LDD regions deepen. Each transistor can include an LDD region subject to said LDD implantation, the oxidation process causing thermal diffusion of LDD regions in the transistor having a higher operation voltage so as to ensure a smooth transition between the LDD region and adjacent n-impurity or p-impurity regions. 
 In the invention, in part, the transistors further comprise PMOS and NMOS transistors, at least one high-voltage and low-voltage PMOS transistor, and at least one high-voltage and low-voltage NMOS transistor. The threshold voltage values of the transistors are adjusted by using a mask to implant p impurities into an NMOS region of the NMOS transistors, and n impurities into a PMOS region of PMOS transistors so as to form a channel in each transistor. Also, the p impurities comprise at least one of boron or indium and the n impurities comprise at least one of phosphorous, arsenic, or antimony. The gate electrode comprises poly-Si or amorphous-Si, and the oxidation process is carried out at a temperature of about 800-1100° C.

" The present invention is a paddle reactor and method for providing enhanced mass transfer of an electrochemical solution to or from the surface of a microfeature workpiece, while at the same time providing control over the electric field at the surface of the workpiece. The reactor of the present invention includes a plurality of electrodes separated by dielectric barriers having gaps that form a corresponding plurality of virtual electrode locations to allow spatial control over the material deposition or removal process at the workpiece. The reactor of this invention also includes an electric field control element that controls the electrical current density in the processing fluid to have different values at different circumferential locations proximate to the workpiece. 
 A particularly useful embodiment of the reactor of this invention includes an array of elongated paddles positioned between a process location (where a workpiece would be positioned for electrochemical processing) and a plurality of electrodes that define a corresponding plurality of virtual electrode locations. One of the electrodes is a thieving electrode positioned apart from the process location to attract ions that would otherwise attach to the peripheral portion of the workpiece during a deposition process, thereby countering the tendency for this region to plate at a higher rate than other regions of the workpiece. The electric field control element includes openings, such as slots or apertures, that provide a greater open area in opposing circumferential locations than in intermediate circumferential locations. The intermediate locations are aligned with the motion direction of the elongated paddles to provide reduced current thieving at these locations, which counteracts an expected tendency for these locations to otherwise plate at a reduced rate. 
 The electrodes, including the thieving electrode, can be removed from the reactor by moving them away from, rather than toward, the process location. Accordingly, the electrodes may be removed without interfering with a magnet positioned at the process location to control the orientation of material applied to the workpiece.

By including the location information in-band, the reliable voice stream may be used to implement location detection to enable the person placing the emergency call to be located in the event the person is not able to properly identify their present location. Additionally, by enabling the voice stream to carry the location information, the operator at the PSAP may be provided with information about the person's location without requiring the installation of any particular equipment at the PSAP and without requiring modification of the existing set of installed ALI databases.

Alternatively or additionally, the location information may be transmitted over the voice channel as a data stream that is able to be interpreted by the PSAP or an electronic device in the PSAP so that the location information may be displayed automatically or on demand by the operator. Optionally, where the location information is not audible, the location information may be formatted to mimic a conventional standard such to make the data appear, e.g., as if it were being generated from an ALI database. 
 The location information may be provided automatically when the call is established, or at another point during the emergency communication session. Alternatively, the location information may be provided on demand, for example by enabling the PSAP operator to request the location information by depressing a sequence of keys. The invention is not limited to when the in-band location information is provided in connection with the emergency communication session. 
 The location information may take on numerous different forms. For example, the location information may contain civic information such as the address of the access device being used to place the emergency call, or may contain geodetic information such as the longitude, latitude, and altitude of the person placing the emergency call. Other types of information may be provided as well and the invention is not limited to these several examples.

" Bismuth is one of the least electrically and thermally conductive metals, and in non-radiological applications, it has been known as a substitute for lead. For example, in glazes and surface treatments bismuth is known to provide high gloss, similar surface material properties, viscosity and resistance to detergents (dishwasher detergents). In optical work, bismuth oxide is known to be useful in replacing lead (in amounts of 50% or less) so as to increase specific gravity, refractive index and durability of the optical equipment. 
 The safety of bismuth oxide may be understood from the fact that it is commonly used in internal prosthesis (bone replacement), in order to create a “radiologically opaque” or “X-ray opaque” part. Such items show up on an X-ray at the low power of radiation which a patient receives, thus marking the location and structure of the prosthetic appliance which has been physically implanted in the body of the recipient.

" The present invention is directed to synchronizing a group of test head modules in a test site designed to perform RF and/or mixed-signal/analog testing when installed in the test head of an open architecture test system. Modules from different manufacturers can be used in the test site, as long as the modules conform to certain rules such as the connector type, the pinouts of the connectors, levels on the pins, and the like. 
 In particular, embodiments of the present invention enable event triggers from digital modules to be routed to an analog synchronization (ASYNC) module, which selectively distributes them to analog/mixed signal modules. When an event occurs, which is a point in time in the pattern when something is to happen, the trigger may activate an analog/mixed signal module to perform a certain operation. For example, when testing a DUT with a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), the digital module may generate a digital pattern that is the equivalent of a sine wave, and the DAC in the DUT may reproduce the corresponding sine wave. The sine wave may then be fed into a digitizer in an analog/mixed signal module, and a trigger from the digital module may be used to tell the analog/mixed signal module when that sine wave is available for capture, which might include some settling time and filter delays. 
 The ASYNC module may also receive triggers from the analog/mixed signal modules and selectively distribute them back to the digital modules. The digital modules can be programmed to wait for an analog/mixed signal module to complete an operation, as indicated by a trigger received from that analog/mixed signal module, before continuing. The ASYNC module may also receive triggers from the analog/mixed signal modules and selectively distribute them to other analog/mixed signal modules, to initiate the operation of that analog/mixed signal module in a preferred sequence. 
 Because embodiments of the present invention enable synchronization of digital and analog/mixed signal modules under pattern control, synchronization can be very precise and repeatable as compared to synchronization from a site controller.

" The present invention eliminates the above-presented problems by means of a wheel suspension without increasing the width of the working machine, decreasing the steerability and complicating the constructions. 
 According to an embodiment of the invention, the corresponding joints of the joint parallelograms of the wheels placed on different sides of the frame, on the frame side, are placed on the same axis of rotation. In other words, the joints of the upper suspension arms are placed on the same axis of rotation and/or the joints of the lower suspension arms are placed on the same axis of rotation. The rotation axes are preferably placed on the center line of the working machine. Thus, the width of the working machine can be reduced, particularly at the location of the wheels, without reducing the length of the moment arms. Without affecting the width, the working machine can also be equipped with wider tyres, or the wheels can be equipped with large turning cylinders for steering the wheels. 
 By placing the cylinder in a vertical position and mounting its one end to the lower suspension arm and its other end to the frame, it is possible to reduce the piston stroke of the cylinder. However, the moment arm of the cylinder can be kept substantially the same as before, but the mounting point in the lower arm can be shifted closer to the frame. Thus, there will be more space for other structures at the outermost end of the suspension arms. Thanks to the shorter piston stroke, the vertical cylinder does not harmfully increase the height of the structure. As the mounting point is placed in the suspension arm and not in its joint, a change in the length of the suspension arm will not necessarily affect the structure of the cylinder, the pressure levels used, or particularly the moment arm. With the vertical position, also the moment arm formed by the suspension arms in different positions will be less changed when the wheel moves up and down. 
 Another embodiment of the invention provides a compact module structure for the wheel suspension and the frame structure in various working machines.

" Apart from their present possibilities of locating and identifying products, the present inventor recognized that transponders are basically capable of performing further functions when they are combined with sensors. Depending on their intended use, further chips or sensors can be integrated, for instance those for measuring temperature, pressure, moisture, or a pH value. In the medical field transponders have not been used so far, and especially in the field of biological surface applications, in particular of the skin, as well as corresponding diagnostic purposes no developments including the use of active transponders have been known so far. 
 This is probably based on conceptual and biological-technical reasons, for instance on the lack of appropriate ways for arranging transponders on biological surfaces, the lack of mechanisms for appropriately arranging and positioning sensors for such biological purposes, as inter alia also the requirements of a mechanical flexibility of the material. Ultimately, another reason probably is the considerable problem of accommodating a suitable energy supply, because for such biomedical purposes longer ranges are required than in the industrial engineering sector so far. 
 Accordingly, one object underlying the present invention is to improve the mobile determination, transmission, and processing of biological data. 
 This object is achieved by using a dermal diagnostic system including an active transponder, wherein the system is composed as a multi-component system including an elastic or flexible carrier matrix in which an active transponder and sensor are integrated so that the sensor is in adequate measuring contact with the skin surface or with subjacent dermal layers, wherein the data detected by the sensor is supplied to the transponder for external transmission and the entire system is adhesively applied to the skin surface.

 To improve and extend the practical use of the present invention, in a further embodiment of the present invention the transponder and/or the sensor are reversibly arranged on the carrier, wherein the reversible arrangement can be performed through complementary devices on the carrier and the transponder chemically by reversible gluing, magnetically or mechanically by hook and loop (Velcro) fastener, snap fastener, or flange connections.

 To improve and extend the practical use of the present invention, in a further embodiment of the present invention the transponder also makes use of optical waves in lieu of radio waves or in combination with the use of radio waves as signals, for example infrared in particular.

" In one embodiment the invention comprises an apparatus for linewidth broadening applied to a laser that emits a light having an output frequency ν and an emission linewidth δE. The apparatus is equipped with an electro-optic modulator for intercepting the light. A noise generator is provided for driving the electro-optic modulator with a radio-frequency (RF) noise signal spanning a certain frequency range such that the emission linewidth δE of the light passing through the electro-optic modulator is broadened to a broadened linewidth δB. 
 In one embodiment of the invention the noise generator is made up of a noise source and a filtering element. For example, the filtering element is a low-pass filter with a passband set within the frequency range of the noise signal. The filtering element can also have a passband control for varying the passband of the filtering element. In one embodiment the noise generator has an essentially flat noise spectrum within the frequency range of the noise signal. Alternatively, the noise generator has a sloping noise spectrum within the frequency range of the noise signal. Furthermore, in some embodiments the noise generator is further equipped with an amplification stage for amplifying the noise signal. 
 The frequency range of the noise signal is preferably a continuous frequency range commencing at a low frequency ωL and terminating at a high frequency ωH. In the preferred embodiment the low frequency ωL is set below the emission linewidth δE of the light while the high frequency ωH is set above the emission linewidth δE of the light. 
 The electro-optic modulator can be selected from among many suitable devices. For example, the electro-optic modulator is an optical crystal of lithium niobate, MgO-doped lithium niobate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP), potassium dideuterium phosphate (KD*P), and potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP). In some embodiments the apparatus is equipped with further electro-optic modulators referred to as secondary electro-optic modulators. Any secondary electro-optic modulator is also set up to intercept the light and is connected to a signal generator for applying a secondary signal to the electro-optic modulator. Thus, the light is modulated by the secondary signal thereby achieving a further broadening of the broadened linewidth δB. 
 In one embodiment the signal generator is a single frequency generator such that the secondary signal contains only one frequency. Any one of the secondary electro-optic modulators driven by a single frequency generator can be configured as a resonant modulator. Alternatively, the secondary signal generator is a noise generator and the signal (secondary signal) it generates spans a frequency range (secondary frequency range). 
 In some embodiments an impedance matching circuit is provided for impedance matching the EOM and the noise generator. More specifically, the EOM is impedance matched to all parts of the noise generator that have electrical impedance. Thus, in embodiments where the EOM is followed by a filter and amplifier, the impedance matching circuit impedance matches those elements with the EOM. In most applications the electrical impedance of the impedance matching circuit is about 50 ohms. 
 The lasers that can be used in the apparatus of invention and that can benefit from the method of invention involve any type of inherently narrow bandwidth lasers. These include, without limitation, edge-emitting lasers, surface-emitting lasers, gas lasers, solid-state lasers, external-cavity diode lasers, titanium-sapphire lasers, diode-pumped solid-state lasers, fiber lasers, and Neodymium-YAG lasers. Both pulsed and continuous-wave (CW) lasers can benefit from this technique. 
 The method of invention is applied to broadening the emission linewidth δE of lasers by intercepting the light they output with the aid of at least one electro-optic modulator. If only one electro-optic modulator is used, then this one is driven with a noise signal spanning a certain frequency range selected such that the light is modulated to broaden the emission linewidth δE to a broadened linewidth δB. In embodiments where the light is also modulated with secondary signals to further broaden the broadened linewidth δB, the secondary signals can be single frequency or they can be noise signals covering a secondary frequency range. 
 A detailed description of the invention and the preferred and alternative embodiments is presented below in reference to the attached drawing figures.

a) a laser for emitting a light having an output frequency ν and an emission linewidth δE; 
b) an electro-optic modulator for intercepting said light;

" The invention is a thermoplastic film having a heat resistant coating. The film is particularly useful in the preparation of bags and associated packaging systems that are used for protecting and packaging articles. Typically, the heat resistant coating melts at a temperature that exceeds the melting temperature of the thermoplastic film and that exceeds the temperature of the heat generated during foam formation. 
 It has been found that varnishes and resins that can be crosslinked or thermoset are particularly useful as heat resistant coatings. In particular, flexographic and gravure inks having self-adhesion temperatures in excess of 275° F. can be applied to the surface of the thermoplastic bags in a sufficient weight to prevent the cushions from fusing together during foam formation. Typically, the inks are solvent-based, water-based, or energy cured. The addition of silicone to the heat resistant coating improves cushion separation. 
 Foam-in-bag products having heat resistant coatings that are in accordance with the invention are adeptly suited to prevent foam cushions from fusing together during packaging. As a result, the foam-in-bag cushions will eliminate many of the problems associated with the high temperatures that can be produced during foam formation and should improve the efficiency and speed at which articles can be packaged. 
 Thus, the invention provides, among other things, a foam-in-bag packaging system in which the bags are coated with high temperature resins or varnishes that can be crosslinked or thermoset, and that preclude foam cushions fusing due to the heat produced during foam formation.
","1. A sheet of thermoplastic film adapted for use in foam-in-bag packaging, the film having a heat resistant coating having a self-adhesion temperature in the range from about 250° F. to 450° F. and wherein the coating substantially covers a surface of the film sufficient to reduce self-adhesion of the film at temperatures below the self-adhesion temperature of the coating, whereby foam-in-bag packages formed therefrom are easily separated after the foam is formed."

" The present invention is directed to combined object level and property level key framing systems, methods, and user interfaces. A user can enter a mode where any change to a property is recorded as a key framing action (e.g., creation or edit) at the current time as indicated by the timeline. When a key frame is created in this mode, the surrounding object level key frames are inspected to ensure that the functionality that users expect from object level key frames is maintained. If a user explicitly creates an animation of an attribute that spans an object level key frame, then that span for the animation is maintained as the user edits. 
 Exemplary embodiments include a method of keyframing an object in which at least one property and a time for the object are identified. As set forth further below, e.g., with respect to FIGS. 1-3, an attribute key frame is a key frame at the attribute level and a compound key frame is a key frame at the object level. A compound key frame can be thought of as essentially a placeholder for a “virtual attribute key frame” on all possible attributes. Other attribute key frames force this virtual attribute key frame to manifest itself on those attributes, as set forth below. 
 A first compound key frame is created at a first time, and then a second time is received for the object, e.g., by moving a playhead in a timeline element. Another compound key frame is created at the second time. Additional times for the object may be received, followed by creation of associated compound key frames at each of the additional times. A change to the property or properties may be received prior to creating the second compound key frame, in which case the second compound key frame incorporates the changes. Additionally, an attribute key frame may be created responsive to the received property change(s) if no attribute key frame exists for the property or properties at the time the received change is received. Alternately, an existing attribute key frame may be changed responsive to the received property change(s) if the existing attribute key frame exists at the time the received change(s) is received. 
 According to additional embodiments, an object may be keyframed by receiving a value for an attribute for the object at a first time, and then, if an attribute key frame corresponding to the attribute exists at the first time, amending the attribute key frame responsive to the received value for the attribute; otherwise, populating a neighboring object key frame (also referred to herein as a compound key frame) with an attribute key frame if an object key frame exists. 
 Populating the neighboring object key frame may comprise (1) if the neighboring object key frame exists later in time than the first time, and an attribute key frame exists later in time than the first time, then setting a first value to the value of the attribute key frame that exists later in time than the first time; or (2) if the neighboring object key frame that exists later in time than the first time, and an attribute key frame does not exist later in time than the first time, then setting the first value to the value of the originally received value for the attribute; and creating a new attribute key frame at the neighboring object key frame using the first value. 
 Additionally, populating the neighboring object key frame may comprise (1) if the object key that exists is earlier in time than the first time, and an attribute key frame exists earlier in time than the first time, then setting a first value to the value of the attribute key frame that exists earlier in time than the first time; or (2) if the object key that exists is earlier in time than the first time, and an attribute key frame does not exist earlier in time than the first time, then setting the first value to the value of the originally received value for the attribute; and creating a new attribute key frame at the neighboring object key frame using the first value. 
 Additional features and advantages of the invention will be made apparent from the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments that proceeds with reference to the accompanying drawings.

" The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is intended neither to identify key or critical elements of the invention nor to delineate the scope of the invention.

 The present invention pertains to determining circuit module robustness or reliability as relates to local and global variations, and in view of the number of modules and yield desired as facilitated by implementing statistical analyses. Robustness to local variation is considered at worst case global conditions, where worst case global takes into account control of the global parameters. Global and local variations are treated differently in statistical analysis of modules since the range of global variation can generally be controlled while the range of local variation can not. 
 According to one or more aspects of the present invention a system operative to test the robustness of a circuit module is disclosed. The system includes a component operative to convey global variation data associated with the module as well as a component operative to convey local variation data associated with the module. The system further includes a modeling component operative to model behavior of the module in response to the global variation data and the local variation data and to generate an output indicative of the robustness of the circuit module to local variation over a range of global variation. 
 In accordance with one or more other aspects of the present invention, a method of determining the robustness of a circuit module is disclosed. The method includes performing a sequence of global statistical evaluations of the circuit module based upon global variation data, and determining a global vector about which to run a local statistical evaluation based upon the sequence of global statistical evaluations. The method thus further includes performing a sequence of local statistical evaluations about the determined global vector. The method then includes evaluating the robustness of the circuit based upon the global and local statistical evaluations.

" A distribution manifold of the present disclosure provides for faster and more reliable installation of water filtration systems within appliances. Generally, the distribution manifold is manufactured as a monolithic assembly having a valve flow block as an integral component of the distribution manifold such that additional downstream valves may not be used. The valve flow block is a portion of the ultimate valve structure generally with the valve seat, but as a part of the unitary, monolithic structure, the valve flow block is only a portion of the monolith with this valve component. The monolithic distribution manifold can comprise a plug connector or the like, wired to a valve structure to promote a quick, simple and reliable electrical interconnection between the distribution manifold and a control system. The valve flow block can be a component of a valve structure incorporating suitable valve designs, for example, solenoid valves. When the valve structure comprises solenoid valves, the valve structure can further incorporate rectifiers or the solenoid valves can be configured for DC power such that the solenoid valves provide for quiet operation with less heat generation. While the monolithic manifold can be held together with reversible fasteners in some representative embodiments, as described below, the monolithic structure is distinguishable from a non-monolithic structure in that the monolithic structure comprises a single unit having no flow connections within the monolithic structure that connect tubing, piping or the like with a flow channel. 
 In one representative embodiment, the present disclosure describes a monolithic manifold assembly. The monolithic manifold assembly can incorporate a variety of integral components such as an inlet, an outlet, a flow channel, a filter receiver and a valve flow block. The monolithic manifold assembly can comprise an electrical connector for interconnecting a valve structure with a control element to selectively allow flow through the valve flow block. The monolithic manifold assembly can comprise a stacked plate arrangement for partially defining the flow channel. 
 In another representative embodiment, the present disclosure describes a water filtration system comprising a monolithic manifold assembly and a replaceable cartridge filter. The monolithic manifold assembly can comprise a filter receiver allowing for quick and convenient attachment of the cartridge filer, for example through rotatable or slidable connecting members. 
 In another representative embodiment, the present disclosure describes a method for reducing the potential for leak point in a water filtration system by eliminating the need for downstream distribution valves. A monolithic manifold assembly can be fabricated to include an integral valve flow block such that downstream distribution valves may not be used or needed. The monolithic manifold assembly can be permanently connected, for example by suitable welding, molding or adhesive joining techniques, as would be known to those skilled in the art and all new techniques that may be subsequently developed that perform the same function. Alternatively, the monolithic manifold assembly can be detachable connected, for example through the use of suitable clamps, bolts or other connectors, allowing for the replacement of components, as would be known to those skilled in the art and all new techniques that may be subsequently developed that perform the same function. 
 In still another representative embodiment, the present disclosure describes an appliance, such as, for example, a refrigerator comprising a water filtration system designed to reduce the potential for downstream system leakage. The water filtration system can comprise a valve flow block to selectively distribute a filtered water stream to points-of-use on the appliance, such as, for example, a manual water dispenser or tap in a refrigerator door or an automated device, such as, for example, an icemaker.

" In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a user analysis is performed on a final circuit netlist. The user analysis includes static timing analysis and formal verification. A snip (or DC adjust) file is initially generated. The snip file includes a selected set of non-critical timing signals and paths of the final circuit netlist that have been elected to be not checked during static timing analysis. Static timing analysis is then performed on the final circuit netlist using the snip file. If the final circuit netlist meets all the timing constraints, the snip file is converted to a group of cutpoints, and formal verification is performed on the cutpoints. A determination is then made as to whether or not the cutpoints pass formal verification. If the cutpoints pass formal verification, the user analysis on the final circuit netlist is completed, and the final circuit netlist can proceed to manufacturing. Otherwise, if the cutpoints do not pass formal verification, a flag is issued to alert a user. The user then has to either modify certain snip points within the snip file or modify the circuit netlist, and perform the user analysis again.

" The present invention is a process for establishing communications with customers and motivating them to go to the company's website, creating a value proposition appealing to customers visiting the website that motivates them to give desired information to facilitate communications with them and leaves them interested in receiving communications from the company, creating website “stickiness” that keeps the customers coming back to the site, and increasing sales and return on investment as a result the process. 
 In one embodiment, the present invention involves a process having steps including placing a respective unique unit identification code (UUIC) on each respective unit of a product that a company produces. After a unit of the product is purchased and consumed, the consumer can access the UUIC code from the product packaging including instructions to navigate to the company's website, enter the UUIC and potentially win a prize. The consumer then navigates to the company's website and is asked to create a user ID including email address and other information of interest to the company. This information is stored in the company's database for subsequent data mining and company initiated communications. A user ID is then sent to the consumer by email to ensure that the consumer's email address is correct. The consumer receives the company's confirming email together with an access code enabling them to sign into the company's website and enter the UUIC for a chance to win the prize. The company's database includes data about all of the UUIC's and a game program that uses the UUIC together with the user's profile to calculate whether the consumer is an immediate winner and to establish whether the customer is potentially a contender for winning a future grand prize. 
 Other additional steps can include enabling the user to enter another UUIC and replay the game each time he subsequently consumes another unit of the product. Another step may be that each time the consumer enters another UUIC, their chances of wining increase. Another step may include the ability of the consumer to enter the email addresses of friends who are or will be playing the game for an increased chance of winning. Another step may include that the status of the consumer's ability to win future prices may change over time as determined by the company's game software and developments regarding other consumers who are participating. Thus the consumer will want to check the website periodically to determine what their status is; are they eligible to win the future prize or are they not. Either way, entering additional UUIC codes will enhance their chances of winning future prizes. 
 Objects and Advantages 
 Accordingly, several objects and advantages of the invention are apparent. It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for collecting information about the consumers of a company's products. This gives the company the advantage of more precisely targeting of their marketing efforts to similar consumers. It is an object of the present invention to gain marketing insights into consumer behavior by using a UUIC to connect a specific consumer with the consumption of a specific unit of a particular product. This gives the company the advantage of a deeper understanding of consumer product acquisition behavior. It is an object of the present invention to motivate the consumer to give their information including email address to the company and to give their tacit invitation (permission) to the company to communicate to them on an ongoing basis. This offers the company the advantage of being able to communicate with the consumer in a welcomed manner. It is an object of the present invention to use consumer word of mouth to generate interest in the company's products. Asking the consumer to link to their friends in the game and bring them into the game offers the company the advantage of creating a word of mouth communication around their products and website. It is an object of the present invention to increase sales revenue. It is an advantage to the company that each time the consumer enters a new UUIC into the game, their chance of winning increases. It is an object of the present invention to create a “stickiness” to a company's website. Creating contender and non-contender statuses effecting eligibility to win a future prize that may change after the consumer leaves the game makes the consumer want to check back into the website periodically to see what their status is, are they still a contender to win our have they been downgraded to non-contender status ineligible to win without entering a new UUIC. Other objects and advantages will become apparent by reviewing the specifications and drawing figure.
","1. A process for an organization to communicate with consumers of a product comprising the steps of;

" In view of the foregoing, the present invention provides a system and method for building run-time images of a software program, such as an operating system, from a plurality of selected software program components, each of which is a discrete packet of functionality. Each component specifies its properties and resources, and provides script for its own build behavior. A component may explicitly contain data defining its properties, resources, and script, or may inherit them from other components through a prototyping relationship. Each component may also specify dependency data, which define dependencies among the components and component groups in terms of component inclusion/exclusion in the run-time image and the orders in which the components are built into the run-time image. 
 The system of the invention provides a general framework for managing components and using the components to build run-time images. The description data for the available components are stored in a database, and the files constituting the components are stored in a repository. The description data for a component defines the properties, resources, and script defining the component's build logic. During a build process, components are selected from the database for use in a configuration. Instances of the selected components are included in the configuration. The scripts of the component instances in the configuration are then invoked to build each of the selected components into the run-time image. 
 To facilitate the tracking of different versions of the components, a versioning scheme is provided that differentiates between revisions and upgrades of an item. An upgradeable item, such as a software program component, has a version-independent identifier, a version-specific identifier, and a revision number. The version-independent identifier of the item stays the same throughout revisions and upgrades. The version-specific identifier, on the other hand, is changed to a new value when the item is upgraded. Thus, there may exist different upgrade versions of the same item that share the same version-independent identifier but have different version-specific identifiers. The revision number is increased each time the item is modified so that the newest version can be easily identified. An item to be retired may be marked as end-of-life and may contain data identifying item or items for replacing it.

" For these and other reasons which will be apparent upon reading the present disclosure, a motion detector camera having a variety of user-controllable functions has been devised. In one embodiment, the motion detector camera includes a housing having a mounting member in a bottom surface for mounting the housing to a tripod, the housing having an film advance mechanism for automatically advancing a film of the camera after each exposure. The camera includes a wide angle lens attached to a front surface of the housing, a motion detector attached to a front surface of the housing, and a flash attached to the housing. The camera also includes a controller for controlling the flash and a shutter of the camera, wherein the controller receives a signal from the motion detector indicating a triggering event and the controller causes the flash to flash if necessary and causes the shutter to form an exposure on the film. 
 In one option, the controller is programmable to cause the camera to take a pre-determined number of exposures per triggering event. In another option, the controller causes a test light to blink when the motion detector is triggered but the controller does not cause the camera to expose any film. In another option, when the camera is turned on the controller regulates a test sequence wherein the test light blinks for a pre-determined amount of time. In another option, when put into a pause state, the controller ignores any triggering events of the motion detector until a pre-determined amount of time has elapsed. In another option, the camera can alternatively place an hour/minute stamp on a picture or a year/date/month stamp on the picture. 
 Among other advantages, these features provide a user with a portable, full-featured motion detector camera.

" The present invention utilizes the efficiency of thermotunneling converters by providing an apparatus within which they can produce electricity in a downhole environment, using the heat energy found in geothermal areas. 
 This apparatus comprises: a vessel comprising a first surface thermally connected to a heat source and thermotunneling converters having a first surface thermally connected to a second surface of the vessel and a second surface thermally connected to a source of cool water. 
 The term “thermotunnelling converter” as used in this disclosure is defined as a gap diode device in which the separation of the electrodes is less than 100 nm. The device may generate electrical current by both thermionic transmission of electrons between the electrodes, thermotunneling transmission of electrons between the electrodes, or a combination of both. 
 In a preferred embodiment, the electrodes of the converter are able to be in very close proximity to each other because they are topologically matched—i.e., any surface deformations in one electrode are mirrored in the other electrode. 
 In another preferred embodiment, the separation of the electrodes is dynamically controlled through the use of active positioning elements, such as piezoelectric elements. 
 The vessel can either be filled with a thermally conductive fluid or it could be a solid heat spreader. 
 This invention solves many of the problems found in prior art. Thermotunnelling converters have the advantage of being far more efficient than present thermal-to-electric energy conversion systems, such as thermoelectric devices, and can also be used at a wide variety of temperatures. They may also be constructed inexpensively and reliably, and are resistant to vibration and shock. In addition, the present invention does not require a vaporization step. Any heat source, be it liquid, solid or gas, can be used, even if the temperature is well below 100 C. 
 A further advantage of the present system is that it utilizes the heat energy found in geothermal sources without needing the introduction of a fluid, thus providing greater efficiency and economical savings and reducing the likelihood that the system may eventually become blocked because of the buildup of minerals. The conversion of heat to energy happens at the heat source and both dry and wet heat sources can be used. It also involves no moving parts and will therefore have higher reliability and prolonged lifetime.
","1. An apparatus for generating electricity in a downhole environment comprising 
(a) a vessel comprising a first surface thermally connected to a heat source,

" Methods and systems are described herein for extending a software program by providing configuration dependent extended classes. In one aspect, class extensions dependent on various software development scenarios may be provided and added to extend core classes. Various class extensions may be combined to develop specially configured classes. In one aspect, classes of a core software program may be defined as either statically or dynamically extensible. If core classes are declared to be statically extensible, a header file combining the core class definitions and their corresponding class extensions may be generated and compiled together to generate an extended class. Such an extended class may be used to extend the core software program in a configuration dependent manner. 
 However, if a core class is declared to be dynamically extensible at runtime, then separate header files comprising the core class declarations and separate files comprising extension declarations may be generated. The header files corresponding to the core classes and those corresponding to class extensions are then separately compiled to generate computer-executable files with links to each other such that the class extensions are added to extend the core classes at runtime. 
 In yet another aspect, extension points may be provided within core class declarations to specifically indicate the point within the core class declarations where class extensions should be injected. An object description language with the appropriate syntax for defining extensible classes and class extensions is also described herein. 
 Also, as described herein is a pre-processor program capable of receiving input in an object description language and generating output in a source code representation to produce an extended version of the software program.

" It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide an improvement to the above application. The transfer station of the present invention also comprises a print roll and an inking roll (anilox roll) immersed in an ink tray. However, instead of printing on the gelatin ribbon in mid-air thus necessitating an electric motor and logic controls to coordinate proper turning of the printing assembly, the apparatus of the present invention functions using the friction of the passing gelatin ribbon, which is an important part of the present invention. The transfer station of the present invention is positioned so that the passing gelatin ribbon is sandwiched between the motor-driven gelatin casting drum and the transfer station's print roll. The turning force and pressure exerted by the casting drum combined with the elastic tackiness of the gelatin ribbon causes the print roll to turn at the same speed as gelatin ribbon. Rotation of the print roll cause rotation of the anilox roll adjacent to the print roll. 
 Another important advantage of the present invention is the ease of routine preventive maintenance: the transfer station of the present invention can be removed, serviced and replaced much faster than U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/236669, thus resulting in improved productivity and reduced labor hours.

" The above needs are met and objects accomplished by providing, an electrode assembly comprising: a hollow inert electrode, containing a metal conductor having a bottom surface substantially surrounded within the hollow inert electrode by a material comprising or consisting essentially of metal foam. The metal foam is preferably nickel foam or nickel alloy foam. The term “metal foam” as used herein means elemental metal, such as all nickel, alloys of at least two metals, and metal coatings on metal, such as a nickel coating on copper foam, and the like. The invention also resides in an electrode assembly comprising: an inert electrode having a hollow interior with a top portion and interior bottom and side walls; a metal pin conductor having bottom and side surfaces, disposed within the electrode interior but not contacting the electrode interior walls; and a seal surrounding the metal pin conductor at the top portion of the electrode, providing a gap around the metal pin conductor bottom surface between the metal pin conductor and the electrode interior bottom and side walls, where a metal foam having a density of from 5% to 40% of the solid parent metal (relative density) fills the bottom portion of the gap. The metal foam is preferably nickel, nickel alloy or copper alloy foam, but coated copper foam, copper nickel foam or a variety of other metallic foams can be used that conform to the appropriate conductivity open cell network and compliancy. The metal foam, such as nickel alloy foam may contain or be coated with, other metals, such as: copper, nickel, silver, palladium or iridium. The metal foam preferably has a conductivity of from about 1,000 s/cm to about 26,000 s/cm (Siemens per centimeter). For sake of convenience, the foam will hereinafter primarily be referred to as “nickel foam”, but this is in no way to be considered limiting. Also, the term “alloy” will mean any wt. % range of at least two metals in a metal body. 
 The inert electrode is preferably a ceramic, cermet, or metal-containing inert anode, the metal pin conductor is nickel or a corrosion protected steel alloy, preferably having a circular cross-section, the nickel foam can have different densities between the pin and interior electrode walls and the pin and interior electrode bottom, and preferably the nickel foam fills 100% of the resulting annular gap at the bottom, lower portion of the anode. The anode assembly is useful for an electrolytic cell. 
 The invention also resides in a method of producing an electrode assembly comprising: (1) providing an inert electrode having a hollow interior with a top portion and interior bottom and side walls; (2) inserting a metal pin conductor having bottom and side surfaces and a metal foam into the hollow interior of the electrode; and (3) sealing the top portion of the electrode.

 The preferred nickel foam connection design alleviates cracked anodes due to differential thermal growth, provides a stable electrical joint resistance which does not degrade with age, and requires only foam between the pin and ceramic or cermet. This allows reduced materials and assembly costs and supports simplified automated assembly.

 The hierarchy of accessibility illustrates a generalization that the lower a noun phrase is on the hierarchy, the less likely it is that this noun phrase will be expressed by a relative pronoun. 
 The accessibility hierarchy, and how it is obtained, is described in greater detail in “Language Typology and Syntactic Description, Complex Constructions”, Chapter 3, written by Edward L. Keenan, edited by Timothy Chopin, 1985; and Keenan, E. L. and B. Comrie, “N.P. Accessibility and Universal Grammar”, Linguistic Inquiry 8: 63-100 (1977). 
 It is also worth noting that some languages make extensive use of what linguists broadly refer to as “cases”. The English language still contains vestiges of an earlier case system. For example, in the pronominal system, the English language distinguishes subject versus object versus genitive with terms such as he, him and his. While linguists have devoted a great deal of time and effort in attempting to distinguish case from thematic role from other kinds of marking, the term case, as discussed herein, is used in the following two senses: 
 1. To describe morphological inflection, which typically involves changing the endings of words. German, Russian and Latin are examples of languages which exhibit morphological case. 
 2. To describe the use of adpositions (prepositions and postpositions) or particles to indicate the grammatical role of a noun phrase. Japanese and Indonesian are examples of languages which exhibit case information of this type. A discussion of grammatical relations and surface case is set out in Shibatani, “Grammatical Relations and Surface Cases”, Language, Volume 53, Number 4 (1977) pp. 789-809. Also, a discussion of grammatical function and morphological case is set out in Maling, “Of Nonminitive and Accusative: The Hierarchical Assignment of Grammatical Case in Finnish”, this article is published in A. Holenberg and U. Nikanne, Case and Other Topics in Finnish Syntactic, Studies in Generative Grammar, Foris (1992), pp. 51-76. In this patent, the term “relations” will be used to refer to both cases and grammatical relations.

" One embodiment of the present invention provides an RF-actuated microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) switch module. The module includes an antenna for receiving an externally-generated RF control signal, and providing an antenna output signal representative thereof. A circuit is operatively connected to the antenna, and is configured for receiving the antenna output signal and generating a trigger voltage. A MEMS switch is configured to actuate in response to the trigger voltage. The circuit may include, for example, a tuned circuit and a detector. Here, the tuned circuit is operatively connected to the antenna and is configured to resonate at the frequency of the RF control signal, thereby providing a continuous wave signal. A detector (e.g., rectifier and capacitor circuit) is operatively connected to the tuned circuit and is configured to generate the trigger voltage based on the continuous wave signal. The RF control signal can have a wavelength, for example, of one millimeter or less. 
 The MEMS switch can be bi-stable, and remain in a switched position until it is subsequently actuated to change to an alternate position. The module can be included within metamaterial having characteristics that can be altered by applying the RF control signal. The characteristics of the metamaterial that can be altered include, for example, at least one of dielectric, reflective, bandgap, and polarization properties of the material.

" The update to the non-volatile erase block management data table often requires that the non-volatile erase block management data table themselves be erased before they can be updated. This introduces additional overhead in the Flash memory device update process, requiring at least two or more Flash block writes and/or erases for each data write to the Flash memory; one for the user data and one for the erase block management data, with possible block erasures required. This has the effect of slowing overall Flash device operation. In addition, with the concentration of writes and erasures in the non-volatile erase block management data tables, the non-volatile erase block management data tables are thus, ironically, some of most likely to see errors from floating gate memory cell write fatigue. 
 FIG. 1 shows a simplified diagram of a Flash memory of the prior art. Internally to the Flash memory device a control state machine 110 directs internal operation of the Flash memory device; managing the Flash memory array 112 and updating RAM control registers and tables 114 and the non-volatile erase block management registers and tables 128. The RAM control registers and tables 114 are loaded at power up from the non-volatile erase block management registers and tables 128 by the control state machine 110. The Flash memory array 112 contains a sequence of erase blocks 116. Each erase block 116 contains a series of sectors 118 that include a user data space 120 and a control data space 122.

" The present invention is a fish tape housing having a handle grip and a generally annular case. The case has two halves each including a radial wall and inner and outer axial half walls. The ends of the axial half walls are in facing relation. The outer axial half walls define a slot between them. Screws hold the case halves together. Together the radial walls and axial half walls define a fish tape receiving chamber. A handle grip has a central portion and two legs which are connected by an arcuate shoe. The shoe rides on the exterior surface of the outer half walls. A web on the underside of the shoe extends through the slot to the interior of the case. A continuous hoop or belt is attached to the web. The belt has a outside diameter slightly less than the inside diameter of the outer half walls. The continuous belt allows users of fish tapes to employ the device without fear of the tape escaping the confines of the housing, should the annular walls separate. The belt constrains the tape within the chamber, even under extreme conditions such as the fish tape being dropped from the top of a ladder, or the like. 
 In addition, the fish tape housing of the present invention provides an improved handle design. The handle has a passageway defined by top and bottom walls and first and second posts. The passageway has a throat adapted to receive the tape therein. The throat defines a longitudinal axis. The first post is disposed laterally of the longitudinal axis on a first side while the second post is disposed laterally of the longitudinal axis on a second side. Thus, the first and second posts are laterally spaced from one another such that a tape in the passageway is restrained on both sides and cannot pop out of the passageway. The first and second posts are also longitudinally spaced from one another to define a laterally-directed port. Installation of the tape in the case is achieved by passing an end portion of the tape through the port and then rotating the coil of tape ninety degrees to place the coil into an open case half. This construction obviates the need to thread the entire tape through the handle passageway.

" This invention is a method and means of assembling a hollow golf club head from metal components using a novel attachment technique that avoids the problems of heat-treating the head. A typical composite golf club head made from titanium is composed of a body, a face-plate, and a sole plate. The titanium body is first cast, then assembled, then a machined face plate and sole plate are attached via inert-gas welding. The resulting composite head is than heat-treated to increase the strength of the materials. 
 In a pure titanium golf club head assembled from components, the metal of the club head is a different alloy than that of the face and sole plates. The face and sole plate require heating to a higher temperature than the metal of the club head itself to achieve the best club performance. 
 Annealing the face and sole plates, by raising them to an appropriate temperature, in a pre-assembled head requires that the entire club head be raised to that temperature, since all the parts are present together. The titanium alloy of the welding material is unable to withstand this temperature without the risk of cracking or deforming, so the optimum face-and-sole plate hardening temperature is never reached during manufacture. 
 The composite club head face and sole plates are therefore softer than needed for optimum performance. In a head pre-assembled and then heat-treated. A new means of assembling the titanium components is required to achieve optimum club performance from a strong and tough club head and a thoroughly hardened sole and face plate. 
 This technique can also be applied to golf club heads assembled from other light metals, such as magnesium.

a golf club assembly technique, the assembly technique comprised of the steps of component manufacture, component finishing, and club assembly, 
the component manufacture step selected from the list of machining, casting, squeeze casting, or metal injection molding golf club components,

" It is the object of the present invention to develop a setting device of the type mentioned above which avoids the aforementioned disadvantages and in which the piston can be removed and changed in a simple and comfortable manner. 
 Accordingly, the securing element is movable translationally between its first position and its second position, wherein the securing element is held in its first position by the bolt guide occupying its assembled position, and wherein the securing element can be moved into the second position by displacing means by moving the bolt guide into its disassembly position. By means of this step, the securing element is automatically displaced along with the bolt guide when the latter is detached from the setting device, and the adjusting member is released and can move out of the piston guide. The user can now pull the piston out of the piston guide without further manipulation. This provides a very user-friendly, comfortable disassembly solution for a setting device. 
 It is advantageous when the displacing means comprise a spring element by which the securing element is spring-loaded in the direction of its second position. The securing element can follow the bolt guide in a technically simple manner by means of this spring element when removing the bolt guide from the setting device. Of course, a plurality of such spring elements can also be provided. 
 Further, the securing element could also be coupled directly to the bolt guide and, therefore, displaced along with it. 
 Reliable functioning is achieved in every position of the device by constructing the securing element as a sleeve part. 
 It is further advantageous when a stop is formed at the securing element, which stop contacts a counter-stop of the bolt guide in the mounted position of the bolt guide in the setting device. This step ensures that the securing element directly operates the assembled position of the bolt guide and follows the bolt guide when the latter is removed from the setting device. 
 It is likewise advantageous when a conical working surface is arranged at the adjusting member and can be moved by a counter-working surface at the securing element. The counter-working surface at the securing element can likewise be conical. By means of this step, the adjusting member can again be moved by the securing element and moved into the work position in the piston guide when the bolt guide is replaced at the setting device without additional manipulation on the part of the user. 
 Further, it can be advantageous when a spring element acts at the adjusting member and loads the adjusting member in the direction of its work position. This step ensures that the adjusting member always remains in its work position when the setting device is being operated. When the adjusting member has been released by the securing element, however, the adjusting member can be moved temporarily into its release position by the setting piston when the latter is pulled out of the setting device. 
 Alternatively, the adjusting member can also be acted upon by a spring element which loads the adjusting member in the direction of its release position. In this way, the adjusting member is automatically moved into its release position when the securing element releases the adjusting member. In its second position or securing position, the securing element then holds the adjusting member in its work position. 
 It is further advantageous when a lock element is arranged at the adjusting member, and the lock element can be inserted into a lock receptacle at the piston guide for locking the adjusting member in its work position. By means of this step, the adjusting member is held in a defined position when the bolt guide is replaced at the piston guide on one hand and is held without force with respect to the securing element on the other hand.

" The present invention has been developed in view of the above circumstances. 
 The object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor laser element being formed of InGaAlP-based materials and having improved static characteristics and a long lifetime. 
 In order to accomplish the aforementioned object, the present invention is provided. According to the present invention, there is provided a semiconductor laser element comprising: a substrate made of GaAs; a lower cladding layer formed above the substrate and made of In0.49(Alx1Ga1-x1)0.51P (x2<x1<1) of a first conductive type which lattice-matches with GaAs; a lower optical waveguide layer formed above the lower cladding layer and made of In0.49(Alx2Ga1-x2)0.51P 0<x2<x1) which lattice-matches with GaAs; an active layer formed above the lower optical waveguide layer; an upper optical waveguide layer formed above the active layer and made of In0.49(Alx2Ga1-x2)0.51P 0<x2<x1) which lattice-matches with GaAs; and an upper cladding layer formed above the upper optical waveguide layer and made of In0.49(Alx1Ga1-x1)0.51P (x2<x1<1) of a second conductive type which lattice-matches with GaAs. In the semiconductor laser element, the total thickness of the lower optical waveguide layer, the active layer, and the upper optical waveguide layer is 0.30 micrometers or greater. 
 Preferably, the semiconductor laser element according to the present invention may also have one or any possible combination of the following additional features (i) to (iii). 
 (i) The total thickness of the lower optical waveguide layer, the active layer, and the upper optical waveguide layer is 0.35 to 0.6 micrometers. 
 (ii) At least one of the lower cladding layer and the upper cladding layer has a thickness of 0.8 micrometers or smaller, and more preferably 0.6 micrometers or smaller. 
 (iii) The active layer is made of In0.49(Alx3Ga1-x3)0.51P (0≦x3<x2), and the semiconductor laser element has an oscillation wavelength of 620 to 680 nm. 
 Since the total thickness of the active layer and the optical waveguide layers is arranged to be 30 micrometers or greater in the semiconductor laser element according to the present invention, it is possible to suppress leakage of light into the cladding layers, and reduce the total thickness of the InGaAlP cladding layers. Since the electric resistance and the heat resistance of the InGaAlP cladding layers are great, it is possible to suppress heat generation during operation and deterioration of the characteristics of the semiconductor laser element. 
 In addition, when the total thickness of the active layer and the optical waveguide layers is 30 micrometers or greater, the thickness of at least one of the optical waveguide layers in the semiconductor laser element according to the present invention is greater than the thicknesses of the optical waveguide layers of the conventional semiconductor laser elements. Therefore, when the optical waveguide layer on the p side of the active layer is undoped, the undoped layer extends between the p-type cladding layer and the active layer. Thus, it is possible to suppress diffusion of Zn into the active layer and deterioration of the semiconductor laser element. In addition, since the optical waveguide layer on the p side of the active layer has the function of protecting diffusion of Zn, it is unnecessary to insert an undoped layer in the p-type cladding layer in the semiconductor laser element according to the present invention, while an undoped layer is inserted as a portion of a cladding layer in a vicinity of an active layer for protecting diffusion of Zn in the semiconductor laser element disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,798,808. Therefore, it is possible to avoid the weakening of the confinement of carriers which is caused by insertion of the undoped layer in the cladding layer.

" It is a primary object of the present invention to provide a pin assignment method that overcomes one or more disadvantages and limitations of the prior art hereinabove enumerated. 
 It is an important object of the present invention to provide a pin assignment method that enables block pins to be assigned to locations internally within a block after placement of the block to place such pins with respect to connectivity to pins of other blocks at the current level substantially concurrently with respect to connectivity to components within the block. 
 It is a further object of the present invention to provide in a pin assignment a method that allows placement of block pins internally within a block and further allowing dropping of vias to these internally located pins. 
 According to the present invention, each one of a plurality of pins are first assigned to a respective one of a plurality of first locations along a periphery of a block and components are then placed within in the block in relative proximity to the pins with which the components connect. Each of the pins may then be moved to a respective second internal location proximal the components to which such pins connect. The components may then have their placement refined in accordance to their relative position to the pins connecting to such components at the second location. 
 A feature in one particular embodiment of the present invention is that the final location of the pins is determined first preferentially with respect to interconnectivity between blocks and then replaced preferentially in accordance with respect to connectivity within the block. This feature advantageously optimizes connectivity constraints between blocks as with the top-down approach concurrently with optimizing connectivity constraints within each block as with the bottom-up approach. By combining the advantages of both approaches in a new and unique process, their respective disadvantages are mitigated. 
 For example, when the pins are first assigned to the block periphery, the top-level connectivity constraints may be taken into consideration for the placement of the pins similarly to the top-down approach. The components to which these pins connect are placed within the block, taking into consideration connectivity constraints between the components and the pins to which the components will connect. After the components are placed, any of the pins may be moved away from the block periphery to an internal location proximal the component to which it connects. The shape of the pins may also, in one particular embodiment, be abstracted to a distributed shape to enhance top-level routability. Internal block connectivity concerns, similar to the bottom-up approach, may be used when moving the pins. Finally, with the pins having been moved, the positioning of the components in the block may be refined, again in accordance with connectivity constraints between components and the pins connecting thereto. Thus, combining the advantages of a top-down and bottom-up approach to pin assignment results in a preferential placement of pins for connectivity to other blocks and cells in the current level of the netlist concurrently with preferential placement of pins for connectivity to components in the block. 
 Another feature in another embodiment of the present invention is that block pins may be placed as virtual pins to reserve spaces for vias. Such virtual pins may be formed in a temporarily created block top layer. The block is routed with connections being made to the virtual pins. The temporary top layer and virtual pins are removed during block abstraction such that pins remaining in the true top layer of the block can be accessed by vias from then next higher level in the netlist. This feature advantageously obviates violation of the prohibition against via stacking by ensuring that a via dropped from a hierarchical level above the block will not stack above a via routed within the block. 
 These and other objects, advantages and features of the present invention will ecome readily apparent to those skilled in the art from a study of the following escription of the Exemplary Preferred Embodiments when read in conjunction with the attached Drawing and appended Claims.

" In view of the foregoing and other drawbacks, disadvantages and problems of the conventional structure, an object of the present invention is to provide a composite writing tool which is provided with a knocking member protruding from the rear shaft to be used in knocking but permits the shaft to be reduced in outside diameter. 
 In order to achieve the above-stated object, according to the invention, a composite writing tool according to the present invention comprises a front shaft for accommodating a plurality of writing shafts always urged backward, a rear shaft, an intermediate shaft between the front shaft and the rear shaft for guiding the writing shafts in the axial direction, said intermediate shaft being unrotatably coupled to the front shaft and rotatably coupled to the rear shaft, a cam sleeve disposed within the rear shaft so as to be unrotatable and movable in the axial direction relative to the rear shaft, for selectively protruding one of the writing shafts and retracting all of the writing shafts upon a relative rotation between the cam sleeve and, the front shaft and the intermediate shaft, and a knocking member coupled to the cam sleeve and protruding out of the rear shaft, whereby knocking of the knocking member allows the writing shaft protruded by the cam sleeve to be subjected to a knocking operation. The rear part of the intermediate shaft is inserted into the cam sleeve, the rear end of the intermediate shaft penetrates a through hole formed in an engaging wall perpendicular to the axial direction within the rear shaft and is engaged with the through hole, and the cam sleeve and the knocking member are coupled to each other through an opening provided within the rear shaft or in the rear shaft. 
 According to the invention, since the rear part of the intermediate shaft is inserted into the cam sleeve and the rear end of the intermediate shaft is engaged with the through hole formed in the engaging wall, the intermediate shaft can be fitted within the rear shaft in a rotatable manner relative to the rear shaft. As the outside diameter of the intermediate shaft is reduced to form it in a non-bulky shape within the rear shaft, the outside diameter of the shaft can be kept small eventually. Since the cam sleeve and the knocking member are linked to each other through the opening formed within the rear shaft or in the rear shaft, when the knocking member is knocked, the knocking force is transmitted to the cam sleeve, and the force can be transmitted via the cam sleeve to one of the writing shafts. 
 The opening can be formed elsewhere than the portion formed with the through hole in the engaging wall. 
 The opening can include a non-annular opening formed in the engaging wall or between the engaging wall and the rear shaft and positioned at an outer portion in a radial direction than the through hole. Since the cam sleeve and the knocking member are linked to each other through the non-annular shaped opening, the cam sleeve can be disposed so as to be unrotatable relative to the rear shaft. 
 An engaging piece passing the opening can be formed at the rear end of the cam sleeve, and the knocking member can be linked to the engaging piece. Since the engaging piece of the cam sleeve and the knocking member are linked to each other, the linking procedure can be facilitated because the engaging piece can be moved in the radial direction, and there will be no fear of damaging any member during the assembling process. 
 In a one embodiment, the knocking member can include a clip. In another embodiment, the opening can be formed in a side surface of the rear shaft. 
 The engaging wall can be formed in a tail cap fastened to the rear end of the rear shaft or can be formed integrally with the rear shaft. 
 The present disclosure relates to subject matter contained in Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-155140, filed on May 25, 2004, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

" The core of the invention involves using one of several optical arrangements to divide light into N distinct beams, which are then analyzed separately using elliptical polarizers optimized for measurements of low retardance samples, and the intensity of these N beams is measured at N detector regions simultaneously. Low-retardance samples to be measured are illuminated with substantially circularly polarized light. Exemplary polarizers and data analysis methods are described in the US patent application titled “Retardance Measurement System and Method” of Shribak and Oldenbourg, filed concurrently herewith and hereby expressly incorporated in its entirety by reference herein; and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,521,705 of Oldenbourg and Mei. These disclosures provide polarization sensing schemes that utilize between 2 and 5 polarization states, which the present invention implements in parallel rather than in time series as in the above references. 
 The polarization analyzers are so chosen that, taken together, the detectors provide enough information to determine the polarization state of the incident light with high sensitivity, for measurement of low-retardance samples. These are analyzers for two or more approximately circular states of polarization, and in some embodiments one which is substantially a circular polarizer, as will be described in the preferred embodiments. 
 These analyzers can employ fixed linear polarizer material together with fixed wave-plates, or together with electrically tunable waveplates such as liquid crystal retarders. In the latter case, the retarder apparatus may comprise one or more liquid crystal cells whose electrodes are pixilated into different spatial regions that match the different facets of the beamsplitter. These regions are driven with selected voltages to produce the required retardance in each region so as to realize a chosen polarization analyzer scheme. 
 In one embodiment, the invention divides the incident light using a single multifaceted prism, which refracts the rays of light to form N separate images corresponding to each facet; these refracted beams are then imaged onto the N multiple detector regions. In optical series with at least two of the facets are elliptical polarization analyzers that selectively transmit a chosen state of polarization for light. 
 In another embodiment, the invention uses one or more partially reflective beamsplitters to divide the incident light into multiple beams, namely a transmitted beam and a reflected beam. Further subdivision by other splitter elements can be employed to provide the full complement of beams as needed. These form N images at multiple detectors, or are redirected to form N images at a single CCD detector. 
 In yet another embodiment, the partially reflective beamsplitters are a “polka-dot” type, constructed using spatially patterned reflective elements to minimize the polarization distortion on the beam being measured. This also provides a more achromatic divider than can be readily obtained with multilayer interference coatings. 
 In another embodiment, the beam is divided by partial reflection at one or more prism beamsplitters, and the optical design provides for substantially equal path length for all the beams, in the region from the initial beamsplitter to the detector. 
 Variations in responsivity across the detector, or in the optical system generally, either between different points in a given image or between images, are compensated for by measurement of the system's response to light with known states of polarization or to, background images with no sample, or combinations thereof. 
 In another embodiment, the beamsplitter is a prism with four facets and the polarization analyzers implement the four elliptical states used in the PolScope described by Oldenbourg and Mei, and sold commercially by CRI, Inc. (Woburn Mass.). The system is used together with a circular polarizer in a system for sample analysis, to yield real-time images of sample retardance. 
 When one or another of these optical systems is constructed, the result is an apparatus for the essentially instantaneous measurement of polarization state across an image; or when used with suitable illumination and suitable analyzers, of sample retardance at all points in an image. 
 In another embodiment, the above system is used for imaging of living cells. In still another embodiment, the above system is used to image structures in oocytes such as the meitotic spindle or the zona pellucida.

" A particular object of the invention is to remedy the above-mentioned drawbacks by proposing a return device that makes it possible to regulate accurately the return force to which the valve is subjected and that, while presenting increased reactivity (i.e. a reduced response time, in particular when engine speed varies suddenly), makes it possible to reduce further the risk of valve hunting. 
 To this end, the invention provides a return device for returning a valve of an internal combustion engine, the device comprising: 



 a piston secured to said valve and mounted to slide in a cylinder; 
 a pressurized fluid feed connected to said cylinder via a feed channel; and 
 a pressure relief valve connected to said cylinder via a discharge channel and arranged to limit the pressure prevailing in the cylinder to a predetermined maximum pressure; 




 said device further comprising means for regulating the maximum pressure as a function of the feed pressure using an affine-type relationship. 
 It is thus possible to cause the rate of the pneumatic spring constituted by the pressurized fluid contained in the cylinder to vary linearly as a function of predetermined parameters, such as engine speed. 
 As a result, the regulation of the return force to which the valve is subjected is improved, thereby reducing the risk of valve hunting. 
 For example, the maximum pressure is a function of the feed pressure using a relationship of the following type: 

PM=λPA+P2

 where: 

 PM is the maximum pressure; 
 λ is a constant; 
 PA is the feed pressure; and 
 P2 is a constant 


 In a preferred embodiment, the pressure relief valve is provided with a return spring, in which case the constant P2 is the rated pressure of said pressure relief valve, delivered by said return spring. 
 In order to satisfy the above-presented pressure relationship, the pressure relief valve is, for example, connected to the feed via a branch channel. 
 In addition, a check valve may also be provided, placed on the feed channel, with the branch channel being connected to the feed upstream from the check valve. 
 The feed may be controlled so as to regulate the feed pressure as a function of one or more determined parameters, such as engine speed. 
 Thus, the feed is preferably controlled so as to increase the feed pressure when the engine speed increases. 
 The invention also provides an internal combustion engine equipped with a return device as presented above.

" In the light of the state of the art described above, it is an object of the present invention to provide a motor-driven power steering control apparatus which is capable of mitigating or suppressing the feeling of discomfort in the steering operation even when occurrence of a trouble is detected in the control apparatus at the moment the driver turns quickly or steeply the steering wheel or the moment a wheel(s) of the motor vehicle drops into a rut or furrow in a road in the course of running.

" It has now surprisingly been found that double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides can be administered for specifically inhibiting the expression of certain proteins in differentiated cells, in particular skin cells, and therefore for formulating compositions suitable for external topical administration. 
 The present invention thus features topically administering at least one double-stranded RNA oligonucleotide which is active on differentiated cells such as the cells of the dermis and the epidermis (melanocytes, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, etc.). 
 Topical administration according to the invention both possesses the features mentioned above and makes it possible to ameliorate or overcome the difficulties which have thus far been encountered. 
 This invention specifically features the expression of proteins in the cells of the dermis and the epidermis or in eukaryotic microorganisms at the surface of the skin, with it being possible for the targeting of the cells to be effected, in particular, by selecting a coating which enables the double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides to spread in the cell which is targeted. 
 The double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides make it possible to specifically inhibit a gene (or several genes in the case of a composition which combines double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides which possess different sequences and which are targeted at mRNAs encoding different proteins). 
 Because of their duplex structure, the double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides are resistant to RNases (enzymes for degrading RNA); the oligonucleotides are not broken down at the surface of the skin. 
 Too, because of their duplex structure, these double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides are unable to undergo folding and self-pairing; in this way, the bioavailability of the active product, that is to say the quantity of double-stranded RNA oligonucleotide which produces the desired effect and which arises in the cells, is markedly improved and makes it possible to use lower quantities of double-stranded RNA oligonucleotide. 
 The compositions comprising the double-stranded RNA according to the invention are particularly suitable for cosmetic or dermatological administration since they make it possible to reach the target cell without an invasive mode of administration and are active without having to penetrate into the cell nucleus.

" By way of introduction, the preferred embodiments described below include methods, systems, and probes for medical ultrasound imaging. By using larger segments for transmit than receive or by using a sparse sampling of elements on transmit than used for receive, the number of transmit beamformer channels relative to receive beamformer channels is reduced. Where the transmit waveformed generators of the transmit beamformer channels are positioned within an ultrasound probe, the space and power requirements of the transmit beamformer channels are reduced based on the reduction in number of transmit segments. 
 Different approaches may be used for reducing the number of transmit channels relative to receive segments. For example, a flexible circuit is connected to one side of a multi-dimensional array and defines transmit segments as groups of two or more elements. A different flexible circuit connects on an opposite side of the elements. The different flexible circuit defines receive segments as individual elements or a fewer number of elements than the transmit segments. Alternatively, switching is used to combine elements into single transmit segments. As another alternative, switching or configuring electrode circuits is used to define transmit segments as sparsely-spaced elements and the receive segments as a less sparsely spaced. In yet another approach, the transmit aperture covers a lesser area than the receive aperture, such as through sparse spacing or having smaller overall dimensions. 
 In a first aspect, a multi-dimensional transducer array is provided for medical ultrasound imaging. A plurality of elements is spaced in a multi-dimensional grid. A structure operable to form a first segment with at least a first element of a plurality of elements is also operable to form a second segment with the first element and an additional element of the plurality. The first segment is free of the additional element. 
 In a second aspect, a multi-dimension transducer system is provided for medical ultrasound imaging. An array of elements is in a multi-dimensional grid pattern. Transmit beamformer channels are connectable with the array. Receive beamformer channels are also connectable with the array. A fewer number of transmit beamformer channels are used for a transmit aperture than receive beamformer channels used for a receive aperture. The transmit and receive apertures have some of the elements in common. 
 In a third aspect, a method for reducing transmit channels is provided for multi-dimensional transducer arrays. A transmit aperture is formed with a plurality, N, of transmit segments on the multi-dimensional transducer array. A receive aperture is formed having a plurality, M, of receive segments on the multi-dimensional transducer array.

" In general, the present invention provides a method, system and program product for validating cached dynamic content web pages in remote caches. Specifically, under the present invention, when a request for a web page is received from a client on a server, the web page is built and analyzed for cacheablity. If the web page is cacheable, an entity tag is generated. The entity tag is generally based on sources of the dynamic content in the web page, and any dependencies on those sources. To this extent, the entity tag not only identifies the various sources of dynamic content in the web page, but it also includes cacheability flags and time values associated with the dependencies. The entity tag is sent to the client with the web page where it is stored in local cache memory. If a subsequent request for the same web page is later issued from the client, the request is accompanied with the entity tag (e.g., in a header). The entity tag is decoded and analyzed by the server to determine whether the web page is still valid. Specifically, the time values in the entity tag are compared to corresponding time values for the sources of the dynamic content. If the time values match, the cached web page is still valid. In this case, a simple status code (e.g., HTTP 304—Not Modified) can be sent to the client. Conversely, if the time values do not match, the web page is no longer valid. At that point, the web page will be rebuilt and sent to the client. 
 A first aspect of the present invention provides a method for validating remotely cached dynamic content web pages, comprising: determining a cacheability of a response to a client request, sources of dynamic content in the response and a set of dependencies on the sources; generating an entity tag based on the cacheability, the sources and the set of dependencies; returning and caching the response and the entity tag on the client; receiving a subsequent request from the client with the entity tag; and analyzing the entity tag to determine if the cached response is valid.

" The present invention relates to a cold-crucible-induction melter for use in treating waste. 
 More specifically, apparatus and methods of operation are provided for a cold-crucible-induction melter of the present invention wherein a single induction power supply may be used to effect a desired thermal condition, distribution, or profile within a crucible by way of independently energized inductors. A first inductor may be disposed radially outside of the walls of the crucible and corresponding to a first longitudinal region and a second inductor may be disposed radially outside of the walls of the crucible and corresponding to a second longitudinal region thereof. Such a configuration may allow for improved control and maintenance of the temperature distribution within the crucible. 
 In another aspect of the present invention, a bottom drain assembly may be configured and positioned to be heated by an inductor of the cold-crucible-induction melter positioned at a radial position radially outside of the walls of the crucible. Further, alternatively or additionally, the bottom drain assembly may include an electrically resistive heater or heaters. Inductive and electrically resistive heating mechanisms may provide responsiveness and improved control for discharging molten material from the bottom drain assembly. In addition, the bottom drain assembly or, more particularly, drain tube therein may be cooled to solidify molten material passing therethrough and thus, prevent discharge of molten material therefrom. 
 Molten material within the crucible may flow in a particular direction or fashion in response to thermal conditions, including, in part and without limitation, heating of the molten material as well as cooling thereto through the walls of the crucible. Therefore, substantially aligning the bottom drain with a flow direction within the molten material may facilitate discharge of the molten material therethrough. Of course, the direction of flow may be associated with convective cells formed in response to thermal conditions as explained above. 
 Also, the present invention contemplates cold-crucible-induction melter induction configurations wherein the skin depth of the induction flux substantially corresponds with the centerline of the cold-crucible containing the waste to be vitrified. Further, the bottom drain assembly may be positioned within the skin depth of the induction flux of an inductor in relation to the material within the crucible. Such a configuration may allow the bottom drain assembly to be heated by the induction coils. 
 Thus, according to the present invention, the bottom drain from which the molten waste and glass may be discharged may be disposed at a position that is offset from the center of the crucible. Disposing the bottom drain at a position offset from the center of the crucible may allow for the bottom drain to be heated by the induction coils, be aligned with a direction of flow of a molten material within the crucible, or both, as mentioned above. 
 The present invention also relates to an improved head assembly design for resisting damage thereto, improving the temperature uniformity in the upper region of the induction melter, and improving safety in operation of the induction melter by reducing external temperatures of the head assembly.

 In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the foregoing and other objects are achieved in methods, apparatuses and machine-readable storage media that determine whether to abort reception of a multi-part message in a code division multiple access communication system. 
 In one aspect, this is determined by receiving a part of the multi-part message. Correlating the received part of the multi-part message with a known sequence generates a correlation value. The correlation value is compared with a threshold level. Reception of the multi-part message is aborted if the correlation value is less than a threshold level. 
 In another aspect, the threshold level is dynamically adjusted based on a communication traffic behavior. The communication traffic behavior may be, for example, whether traffic directed to a particular user equipment (UE) is part of a burst directed to that UE. 
 In yet another aspect, detecting whether traffic directed to the particular UE is part of a burst directed to that UE comprises detecting whether the UE has been addressed at any time during a number, n, of the most recent transmission time intervals. The number, n, may, for example, be equal to 10. 
 In still another aspect, the threshold level may be permitted to assume any one of a plurality of possible threshold levels. In such embodiments, determining whether to abort reception of the multi-part message comprises ensuring that the threshold level takes on a lower one of the plurality of possible threshold levels if it is detected that traffic directed to the particular UE is part of a burst directed to that UE; and ensuring that the threshold level takes on a higher one of the plurality of possible threshold levels if it is not detected that traffic directed to the particular UE is part of a burst directed to that UE. In some embodiments, the plurality of possible threshold levels may comprise only a low threshold level and a high threshold level. 
 In some embodiments, the code division multiple access communication system is a High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) system. In such embodiments, the part of the multi-part message might be a High Speed Shared Control Channel Part 1 (HS-SCCH Part 1) message.

" Accordingly, it is the general purpose and object of the present invention to provide a pulsed charge field contained in an electromagnetic field conformed for raising the excitation states of molecular bonding in biological molecules. 
 Other objects of the invention are to provide a pulsed charge field including frequency spectra in each pulse within the frequency domain of a wet circuit. 
 Yet further objects of the invention are to provide a pulsed charge circuit completed through the charge architecture of living matter. 
 Further objects of the invention are to provide a conveniently implemented electrical charge field in circuit with the wet circuit charge architecture of living matter. 
 Yet additional objects of the invention are to provide a right hand spin polarizing electromagnetic field superposed onto a charge field conformed to raise the excitation state of biological matter. 
 Briefly, these and other objects are accomplished within the present invention by providing a direct current powered oscillator circuit transformer coupled to a plurality of voltage doubler stages connected to the positive charge terminal that is shaped in the form of a flat plate. The plate, in turn, is enclosed on the exterior surface of a generally flat gas filled chamber that can be pressed to the selected limb or body area of a person with the local charge differential across the chamber then providing localized electrical potentials which effect an energy state change in the gas along with the associated radiation. By selecting a molecular structure of the gas similar to the molecular structures in the adjacent tissue a part of the emitted radiation is then absorbed in the adjacent molecular arrays of the body, raising the excitation levels in the tissue which propagate until a local equilibrium is reached. This equilibrium includes the ambient setting through which the ground return part of the circuit is completed, with the lack of observable radiation then providing an indication that the circuit impedance may be too high, i.e., that the contact skin area may be too dry. In this manner the polar molecules that are associated with all living tissue are included in the circuit lattice responding both to the electrical potential and to the gas emitted radiation. 
 The radiated emissions thus produced can then be further controlled by a superimposed electromagnetic field produced on the interior of a coil surrounding the flat negatively charged plate and the chamber on which it is fixed. A further pulse circuit may then be connected across the coil, thus exciting the electromagnetic field to its selected pulse frequency. As result the emissions in the chamber are uniformly right hand spin polarized along their vectors that coincide with the field vector within the coil, thus insuring a relatively uniform absorption within the generally polar architecture of the molecular lattice that forms the irradiated tissue. 
 Those skilled in the art will appreciate that virtually all organic molecules are associated with a distributed electrical charge. Very frequently it is this charge distribution that determines the lobes and foldings of the larger molecules like proteins or peptides and it is the occasional distortions in this charge determined geometry that is often the suspected causative agent associated with disease. Simply, the lobe architecture of a large molecule may be altered by external effects which then alters the molecular interactions with, e.g., receptors, until rearranged to equilibrium state. Of course, the disease consequence associated with distortions in our largest molecules, the chromosomes, are well appreciated at this time and fundamental reasoning dictates that the adjacent smaller molecules will invariably have some effect across the whole range of molecular sizes. It is this effect that is conveniently allowed to resolve itself by the inventive structure disclosed herein.

" The invention relates to a connector with a housing made of a synthetic resin, and a lock arm for holding a mating connector in a connected state. The lock arm is made of metal and is held pressingly on the housing so that at least partly of the lock arm is in a recess in the housing. Thus, a projecting height of the lock arm from the housing can be reduced as compared to prior art connectors that have a housing molded integrally with a lock arm. As a result, the connector can be miniaturized. 
 The housing has at least one cavity for at least one terminal fitting. Each cavity has a resiliently deformable lock that engages the terminal fitting to retain the terminal fitting in the cavity. The lock preferably project from an outer surface of the housing during the deformation. The lock projects from the outer surface of the housing if the terminal fitting is left insufficiently inserted in the cavity. Thus, insufficient insertion of the terminal fitting can be detected visually. The lock arm preferably is mounted on the outer surface of the housing from which the lock can project and is mounted after the terminal fittings are inserted. Thus, the lock arm does not hinder visual confirmation of the lock. 
 The lock arm preferably faces the locks and can be retracted into deformation spaces for the locks during the resilient deformation. Thus, the lock arm and the locks share the same deformation space and the connector can be miniaturized further as compared to connectors that have separate deformation spaces for the locks and the lock arm. 
 The lock arm preferably has at least one press-in portion that projects down towards the housing. The housing has at least one press-in groove for receiving the press-in portion of the lock arm. Thus, the lock arm can be mounted easily on the housing. 
 The housing preferably has a receptacle for receiving the mating connector and the lock arm is engageable with an engaging portion of the mating connector to hold the mating connector in a connected state. 
 The lock arm may be in a lock-arm arranging space recessed the receptacle. 
 The lock arm may undergo a seesaw-like displacement. A lock may be at one end of the lock arm and may engage an engaging portion of the mating connector. An operable portion may be at an opposite end of the lock arm and may be operated to incline the lock arm and disengage the lock from the engaging portion. 
 A metallic reinforcement may cover at least part of an outer surface of the housing where the lock-arm arranging space is formed. The reinforcement compensates for a reduced strength of the housing attributable to the lock-arm arranging space. The construction is simplified by forming the lock arm unitarily with the reinforcement. 
 The housing may be configured for being fixed to an electric or electronic device, such as a circuit board. The reinforcement preferably is integral or unitary with a board-fixing portion to be fixed to the electric or electronic device, thereby further simplifying the construction.

" Methods for the integration of airgaps in a semiconductor device and devices produced by such methods are disclosed. One embodiment of such a semiconductor device includes a stack of layers, where the stack of layers has at least one sub-stack of layers. The sub-stack of layers includes a liner layer formed from a liner material and a sacrificial layer formed from a sacrificial layer material. The liner material is resistant to a first etching substance, while the first etching substance is able to etch the sacrificial layer material. In certain embodiments, the sacrificial layer takes the form of a dielectric layer, which is situated under the liner layer. 
 The liner layer material is situated on top of and under the sacrificial layer (e.g., as multiple liner layers).

" As described in greater detail herein, a method and apparatus for preconditioning data to be transferred on a switched underlay network alleviates the data access and transfer rate mismatch so that large files may be effectively transferred on the network. According to one embodiment of the invention, one or more storage meta-managers are provided on the network to interface data source and data target resources to prepare the data files for transmission over the network. Specifically, when a large file is to be transferred over a fast connection, e.g. an optical channel, the meta-manager may precondition the file to be transferred by breaking it into multiple pieces and distributing those pieces between multiple storage subsystems, each of which has access to a network element with access to the switched underlay network resource. When the data has been distributed and is ready to be transferred, the storage resources begin reading and simultaneously provide the data to the network element. The network element multiplexes the data onto the optical channel or otherwise makes the data available to the switched data resource so that the data may be provided at a higher data rate. The file is then passed across the network over the switched underlay network resources and a similar process de-multiplexes the data on the data target end. In this manner a meta-manager may effect the transfer of large files across the network at high data rates using lower data rate storage systems. The data once transferred may optionally be collected and reconditioned into a single file for use by computation and other resources at the data target. The storage resources may be associated with the network element or may be independent of the network element and connected to the network element.

" Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a apparatus and a method for controlling valve actuation that maintain the engine operational state in a preferable state when adjustment is carried out, used in an internal combustion engine adjusting the valve actuation of intake and exhaust valves. 
 To achieve the foregoing and other objectives and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, the invention provides a control apparatus for valve actuation of intake and exhaust valves of an internal combustion engine. The apparatus controls actual actuation of each of the intake valve and the exhaust valve to the corresponding target actuation. One of the intake valve and the exhaust valve is a first valve and the other is a second valve. The actuation of the second valve is set within a predetermined permitted range. The apparatus includes a first computing portion that computes the target actuation of the first valve and a target valve overlapping amount according to the engine operational state. The target valve overlapping amount is a target amount of a valve overlapping amount of a valve opening period of the first valve and a valve opening period of the second valve. The first computing portion computes the target actuation of the second valve based on the target valve overlapping amount and the actual actuation of the first valve. A second computing portion computes a requested actuation of the second valve based on the target valve overlapping amount and the target actuation of the first valve. When the requested actuation is out of the permitted range of the second valve actuation, the second computing portion corrects the target actuation of the first valve based on the margin between the requested actuation and a limit of the permitted range. 
 Another aspect of the present invention provides a method for controlling valve actuation of intake and exhaust valves of an internal combustion engine. The method includes obtaining a target actuation of the first valve and a target valve overlapping amount according to the engine operational state. A target actuation of the second valve is obtained based on the target valve overlapping amount and the actual actuation of the first valve. A requested actuation of the second valve is obtained based on the target valve overlapping amount and the target actuation of the first valve. The target actuation of the first valve is corrected based on the margin between the requested actuation and a limit of the permitted range when the requested actuation is out of the permitted range of the second valve actuation. The actual actuation of each of the intake valve and the exhaust valve are made to the corresponding target actuation. 
 Other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention.

" The present invention provides a transparent optical switch for a wave division multiplexing (WDM) based network having optical pass through paths and optoelectronic signal conversion for client interfaces in accordance with the present invention. This arrangement provides path level signal control and performance monitoring. While the invention is primarily shown and described in conjunction with a dense wave division multiplexing (DWDM) system, it will be appreciated that the invention is applicable to optical systems in general in which it is desirable to provide optical signal pass through paths through a switch with efficient performance monitoring, network management, control and fault detection. For example, the invention is applicable to WDM systems without optoelectronic conversion. 
 In one aspect of the invention, an optical network includes an optical switch that extracts predetermined optical data traffic on a polling basis. The extracted information is converted to the electrical domain and examined at the bit level. In one embodiment, the system can extract data from input and/or output ports of the switch to verify connections through the switch. Selected data can be injected into the optical switch via input ports and extracted from output ports for analysis by signal analyzers. This arrangement also enables performance monitoring of the optical data stream by tapping selected data. 
 In a further aspect of the invention, an optical switch includes first and second switch fabrics for providing 1:2 broadcast capability. Each switch input port splits an input signal into a first signal received by the first switch fabric and a second signal received by the second switch fabric. In normal operation, the same output port receives the first and second signals and selects only one so that if one of the switch fabrics fails, the output port can select the signal from the operational switch fabric. Thus, the first and second switch fabrics provide redundancy. 
 The first and second switch fabrics can be used for bridging a signal from one input port to two output ports. The first switch fabric connects an input signal to the first output port and the second switch fabric connects the same input signal to the second output port. In one embodiment, the redundant switch fabrics are used for bridging by sacrificing the fabric redundancy. 
 In another aspect of the invention, an optical communication system includes first and second optical switches between which optical networks, such as DWDM networks, are coupled. The switches and the DWDM networks combine to provide unequipped signal generation. In an exemplary embodiment, transponders are located at section termination points in the DWDM networks. The transponders detect unequipped connections and generate unequipped or so-called keep-alive signals to the switch, which loops the signal back to an associated switch. With this arrangement, unequipped conditions are detected and so-called keep alive or unequipped signals are generated as needed without unequipped signal generation within the transparent cross-connect system. 
 In a further aspect of the invention, an optical communication system includes transparent optical switches and a DWDM network. The DWDM network inserts port ID information into signal overheads, for example, of data traveling to a first optical switch from a second switch. Similarly, the DWDM network inserts port ID information into signal overhead of data traveling from the first switch to the second switch. In an exemplary embodiment, transponders associated with the DWDM ports can detect and insert port ID information. The first and second switches can exchange port ID information to identify port connections between the switches. This arrangement enables the optical communication system to automatically determine the network topology, e.g., automatic topology discovery.

" In accordance with the present invention, techniques for supporting enhanced media communications are provided. According to particular embodiments these techniques enable the sharing of media capabilities among devices. In particular, these techniques can enable a computing device to receive enhanced media packets through an audio link established with a remote device. For example, video packets may be transmitted or received by a computing device through an audio link established by an associated telephony device. As another example, these techniques can enable enhanced media packets to be communicated from one computing device to another through an enhanced media link. 
 According to a particular embodiment, a method for supporting communications involves establishing a communications conference that includes multiple conference participants that each provide an audio stream. Audio data packets in the audio streams are identified, and audio information from selected audio data packets is mixed to generate a conference audio stream that is communicated to the conference participants. Enhanced media packets in at least one of the audio streams are identified, and the enhanced media packets are communicated to selected conference participants. 
 Embodiments of the invention provide various technical advantages. These techniques may increase the usefulness of communications with remote devices. For example, audio and enhanced media packets, such as signaling and video packets, may be communicated with a remote device. Communication of enhanced media packets through an audio link or an enhanced media link may reduce complexities associated with communicating the enhanced media packets. For example, communication of enhanced media packets may automatically occur when two devices share an enhanced media capability. Costs associated with developing and manufacturing a stand-alone application may be reduced by distributing functionality, for example, between a packet-based telephony device and a computing device. According to particular embodiments, appropriate media communication links may be serviced by a call manager. Furthermore, a bridge may support enhanced media communication between and/or among multiple conference participants. These techniques may increase the ease-of-use associated with point-to-point communications as well as with conference communications. Additionally, these techniques may facilitate additions or changes to signal protocols used by telephony applications that will not be dependent or require changes in traditional signaling mechanisms. 
 Other technical advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures, descriptions, and claims. Moreover, while specific advantages have been enumerated above, various embodiments may include all, some, or none of the enumerated advantages.

" It is an advantage of the present invention to provide a unique dispensing container that offers significantly improved manufacturability, functionality, and ease of use. The inventive container utilizes a rotatable circumferential ring for dispensing container contents. The rotatable ring approach reduces inadvertent spillage of contents and allows a level of child-proof closure. This approach also has advantage in that it provides a reduced-abrasion, rotary closure for the container that does not require leaving one compartment empty in multi-compartment embodiments. The container can be sold pre-loaded with items, and thus, the scope of the invention extends to the container itself, as well as to the combination of the container and its contents. 
 In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention, an essentially round, hand-operated dispensing container is formed from a top shell mated with a bottom shell and a rotatable ring. Each shell comprises an essentially flat bottom or top, respectively, and a cylindrical outer sidewall. When the shells are mated together, an enclosure is formed for storing objects, and the outer sidewalls form a bearing race for the external ring to rotate about. The top and bottom each have means to provide lateral containment of the ring in the race. An opening is provided in at least one of the sidewalls. An opening in the ring can be selectively aligned with the sidewall opening to allow passage of objects into or out of the container. To close the container, the ring opening is rotated away from the sidewall opening. 
 In accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the invention, a round hand-operated dispensing container includes top and bottom shells, which each include interior partitioning walls that mate to form multiple separate compartments. Each compartment has its own sidewall opening, making it separately accessible by rotation of the ring. 
 In accordance with a further exemplary embodiment of the invention, a round hand-operated dispensing container includes a lid that allows access to multiple compartments simultaneously. The lid can be formed in either the top or bottom shell. In this embodiment, the container can include one or more central compartments that are accessible only through the lid opening and not through the ring opening(s). The lid permits the container compartments to be easily loaded with objects. This is particularly useful for pre-loading the container with items, such as pills or tablets, prior to distributing it to end users.

" In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, a method of driving a threshing rotor of an agricultural combine includes coupling a hydrostatic motor to the rotor and driving the rotor to accelerate from a prevailing velocity to at least generally a commanded rotational velocity. The motors are preferably selectively coupled to the rotor via a common gearset and can be controlled to accelerate and maintain the rotor at a constant velocity. 
 In a particularly preferred method, the hydrostatic motor is always coupled to the rotor, and the mechanical motor is uncoupled from the rotor only during the first phase of rotor acceleration from rest. This control technique reduces clutch wear during at least a substantial portion of the rotor acceleration phase. Then, after the mechanical motor is coupled to the rotor, the hydrostatic motor remains coupled to the rotor, and its output is modulated as necessary to maintain the rotor velocity at least substantially at the commanded rotor velocity. 
 In order to in crease the range of available rotor speeds for a given, relatively narrow mechanical motor speed range, the method may additionally include selecting one of a plurality of a desired rotor speed ranges by operation of a multi-speed gearbox located between the gear-set and the rotor. 
 The method preferably additionally includes detecting a rotor slug condition in which the rotor is jammed and manually controlling the system to uncouple the mechanical motor from the rotor and to deslug the rotor by controlling operation of the hydrostatic motor so as to free the rotor. The controlling step may comprise alternatively and repeatedly running the hydrostatic motor in forward and reverse directions. 
 In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a threshing rotor drive system comprises an agricultural threshing rotor, a mechanical motor, a hydrostatic motor, a gearset located between the motors and the rotor, and a control system that controls the gearset so as to at least selectively couple at least one of the motors to the rotor. The control system is dimensioned and configured to couple the hydrostatic motor to the rotor to accelerate the rotor from a prevailing velocity to at least approximately a commanded rotational velocity. 
 The gearset preferably includes a sun gear coupled to the hydrostatic motor, a plurality of planet gears coupled to the rotor, and a ring gear operatively coupled to the planet gears. A clutch is responsive to the controller to selectively couple the mechanical motor to the ring gear, and a brake is responsive to the controller to selectively arrest the ring gear from rotation. 
 The mechanical motor preferably (but not necessarily) comprises an engine of a harvesting machine incorporating the rotor, and the hydrostatic motor preferably is driven by a variable output pump which is driven by the engine. 
 Other objects, features, and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description and accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the present invention, are given by way of illustration and not of limitation.

","1. A method of driving a threshing rotor of an agricultural combine, comprising: 
(A) coupling a hydrostatic motor to said rotor and driving said rotor to accelerate from a prevailing velocity to at least generally a commanded rotational velocity; and 
(B) coupling a mechanical motor to said rotor when a conditional threshold is reached."
" The method according to the invention consists in the fact that the video signals to be stored are divided into a plurality of parallel data streams, that the data streams are time-compressed in such a way that the compressed data streams take up only a part of a predetermined write-read cycle for the random access memory, that data streams read from the random access memory are conducted via the further memory and combined to form video signals. 
 The method according to the invention enables rapid reading and writing, so that even video signals with very high bit rates can be stored. Moreover, SDRAMs with large capacities can be obtained at low cost. In the case of the method according to the invention, the rapid writing and reading is made possible in particular by virtue of the fact that not every memory location need be addressed individually, rather only one bank address is used for a data block comprising 512 pixels, for example, which are read again in the same sequence. Nevertheless, the method according to the invention is extremely flexible and enables the video signals to be read in a manner largely independent of the clock and the structure (number of pixels, number of lines, interline or progressive) of the video signals supplied. 
 In order to enable reading of the video signals faster than writing, the method according to the invention may provide for the write-read cycle to comprise a write period and at least one read period. In this case, it has proved to be advantageous if the write-read cycle comprises a write period and three read periods. 
 An advantageous refinement of the method according to the invention consists in the fact that the write or read periods in each case contain, prior to the writing or reading, respectively, control time segments for setting the random access memory for writing or reading, respectively, and, after the write or read periods, respectively, control time segments for terminating the writing or reading, respectively. In said time segments, all the commands required for the subsequent writing or reading are fed to the random access memories. 
 In this case, it may furthermore be provided that the random access memory is furthermore refreshed in the time segments. This refinement can be developed such that in the control time segments preceding the writing or reading, the following code sequence is fed to the random access memory: NOPS, PALL, NOPs, REF, ACTV, ACTV, NOPs. 
 By virtue of the fact that the control time segments contain defined signals—in contrast to the continuously changing video data—the signals in the control time segments can readily be utilised for the synchronisation of digital measurement and test devices. 
 In a method embodied in practice, it was furthermore provided that in the control time segments after writing or reading, the following code sequence is fed to the random access memory: BST, PALL, REF, NOPs. 
 Details of these code sequences depend on the respective embodiments of the SDRAMs. 
 The division of the video signals (demultiplex) may be chosen differently depending on requirements made of speed, made of quantity of video data to be stored, and depending on the SDRAM used. In a method carried out in practice, it has proved expedient for the video signals to be divided pixel by pixel.
","1. Method for storing video signals at a first rate and reading the stored video signals at a second rate; comprising the steps of: 
compressing video signals to be stored; 
storing the compressed video signals in a memory; 
operated synchronously during writing and reading; 
reading said compressed video signals from said memory into a first buffer at a first rate; 
reading from said first buffer at said second rate such that said compressed digital signals are decompressed."

" In surmounting prior art disadvantages, the present invention provides “reverse tanking” waterproofing for detail areas and other surface irregularities. An exemplary waterproofing membrane of the invention, having a three-dimensional contour surrounded entirely or partially by a flat collar portion, can be positioned over tiebacks or other surface irregularities, and seamed with conventional reverse tanking membranes to provide a continuous waterproofing barrier. Preferably, such shaped membranes are used in combination with correspondingly shaped molded support structures to prevent the membranes from collapsing under the weight of post cast concrete (i.e., concrete which is cast against them after they are installed). 
 In an exemplary method of the invention, a molded rigid plastic or metal dome is positioned over a tieback and fastened to the formwork, and a “shaped” waterproofing membrane having a corresponding dome shape is fitted over the support and seamed with adjacent “sheet-form” waterproofing membranes on the formwork to provide a continuous moisture barrier. The term “shaped” will be used to define the reverse tanking membranes of the invention, in contrast to the term “sheet-form” which will be used to define conventional reverse tanking membranes (typically supplied in roll form). 
 As another example, a waterproofing membrane having a three-dimensional shape, such as a circular- or conical-shaped sleeve, surrounded by a contiguous flat collar portion, may be employed for waterproofing around penetrations such as pipes and pile caps. Three-dimensional shaped waterproofing membranes, having shapes such as domes, cones, cylinders, pyramids, or other three-dimensional forms, will save several steps otherwise needed for providing a continuous barrier at penetration joints. Such membranes may have at least one or both major faces coated with one or more conventional waterproofing adhesive layers (e.g., rubberized asphalt, synthetic polymeric adhesives, clay-based adhesives, etc.) which are operative to bond with fresh concrete. 
 The present invention is also directed to waterproofed structures formed by the methods described herein, as well as to shaped waterproofing membranes and methods for making such membranes. An exemplary method for making shaped membranes comprises: providing a laminate having a carrier support sheet and, contiguous therewith, a continuous pressure-sensitive waterproofing adhesive layer, with optionally a protective polymeric coating layer and/or particle coating layer over the adhesive layer; and molding the laminate as one piece to provide a shaped waterproofing membrane having a three-dimensional contour that is entirely or partially surrounded by a flat collar portion. Preferably, the carrier support sheet comprises a polyolefin blend that is operative to be molded below 300° F. More preferably, the support sheet comprises a blend of LDPE and HDPE resin, and the pressure-sensitive adhesive is a non-bituminous synthetic adhesive (e.g., SIS). 
 The choice of materials is such that the laminate may be thermally molded into a three-dimensional contour at temperatures below 300° F., and more preferably below 250° F., without destroying the continuity of the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer or protective coating layer, nor the ability of these layers to provide a waterproofing bond with post cast concrete. 
 Other advantages and features of the invention are discussed in further detail hereinafter. 
","1. A method for waterproofing building or civil construction surfaces having irregularities, comprising: 
providing at least one sheet-form waterproofing membrane having a carrier support sheet with first and second opposed major faces, and, disposed over a first major face thereof, a preformed pressure-sensitive waterproofing adhesive layer operative to bond with fresh concrete cast against said first major face and allowed to harden; and

" According to the present invention, these objects are achieved by a system and method as defined in the claims. The dependent claims define advantageous and preferred embodiments of the present invention. 
 A system and method for removing impulsive noise from a digital signal using the maximum and minimum values in a local neighborhood are disclosed. The methodology described in the present invention differs from the well-known method of using a median filter for impulsive noise removal by using the maximum and minimum operators instead of the median operator. These operations greatly reduce the computations necessary for each pixel, which is a significant factor for many hardware and software implementations. Thus, the principles of the present invention advantageously reduces and/or removes impulsive pixels regardless of their origin. 
 In one aspect, the present invention processes a video signal comprising a sequence of frames, each of which further comprises a plurality of pixels. The present invention determines a neighborhood maximum or a neighborhood minimum for a pixel of interest, and compares the intensity of the pixel of interest to the neighborhood maximum or the neighborhood minimum to determine whether the pixel of interest should be replaced. The pixel of interest is replaced with a minimum replacement value if the intensity of the pixel of interest is less than the neighborhood minimum. In one embodiment, the minimum replacement value is the neighborhood minimum. The pixel of interest is replaced with a maximum replacement value if the intensity of the pixel of interest is greater than the neighborhood maximum. In one embodiment, the maximum replacement value is the neighborhood maximum. 
 In another aspect, the present invention compares the sum of the intensity of the pixel of interest and a LOW_OFFSET to the neighborhood minimum. The pixel of interest is then replaced with a minimum replacement value if the sum of the intensity of the pixel of interest and the LOW_OFFSET is less than the neighborhood minimum. In one embodiment, the minimum replacement value is the neighborhood minimum. The present invention may also compare the intensity of the pixel of interest to the sum of a HIGH_OFFSET and the neighborhood maximum. The pixel of interest is then replaced with a maximum replacement value if the intensity of the pixel of interest is greater than the sum of the HIGH_OFFSET and the neighborhood maximum. In one embodiment, the maximum replacement value is the neighborhood maximum. 
 In calculating the neighborhood maximum or the neighborhood minimum for one embodiment of the present invention, the neighborhood does not include the pixel of interest. Additionally, the size of the neighborhood for calculating the neighborhood maximum or the neighborhood minimum may be as large or as small as desired. For example, a neighborhood may be an M×N neighborhood or a non-rectangular shaped neighborhood. The neighborhood may also be an adjustable neighborhood in which the size and/or shape of the neighborhood may be adjusted based on some metric or set of criteria. For example, in one embodiment, the size of the neighborhood may be adjusted for pixels lying on the boundary.

 The present invention provides, for a parking brake system, a connecting device for connecting an auxiliary voltage source with which the parking brake is able to be operated on an auxiliary basis if the electrical supply fails. Thereby the parking brake may be locked or released using on-board arrangement, such as a battery, even if there is a total breakdown of the vehicle electrical system. 
 According to a first exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the connecting device includes terminal contacts to connect an auxiliary battery (i.e. one or more 1.5V or 9V batteries). In this exemplary embodiment, the battery may be connected directly to the terminal contacts. This may provide that no further auxiliary arrangement, such as, for instance, a battery adapter, are required.

" In a device for establishing noise in a motor vehicle including a housing or hollow body which is divided by at least one sound transmission device into at least two spaces, of which one space is in communication via an inlet line with a gas-carrying line of an internal combustion engine arranged in the motor vehicle and the other space is acoustically coupled by means of an outlet line to at least one of an interior space of the vehicle or to the space surrounding the vehicle, a valve device is arranged in the inlet line and/or in the outlet line, which is capable of reducing the cross-section of the respective line in dependence on a control variable. 
 The valve device provided in according with the invention in the line leading to the housing or extending from it makes it possible to reduce the cross section of the respective line and in this way influence the noise level transmitted by the device according to the invention into the interior space and/or the space surrounding the motor vehicle. 
 The valve device is in this case subjected to a control variable, various control variables being usable depending on the application or the desired noise transmission by means of the device according to the invention. 
 In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the control variable may be a pressure prevailing in the gas-carrying line. In this way, a dependence of the noise transmission on the respective load state of the engine is achieved, which makes it possible particularly advantageously for corresponding information concerning the load state of the engine to be passed on to the driver of the motor vehicle. 
 In this connection, the gas-carrying line may be an intake line leading to the engine, and a connecting line for tapping the pressure branches off the gas carrying line upstream of a throttle valve arranged in the intake line. 
 Tapping the intake line upstream of the throttle valve establishes a definite coupling of the transmitted noise to the position of the throttle valve, and consequently in principle to the position of the gas pedal, so that, in particular when driving in a sporty style, a corresponding noise transmission to the driver takes place. 
 A simple structural design in the case of this embodiment resides in an arrangement wherein the control line extends to the valve device, so that the valve device is directly acted on, and consequently activated by, the pressure in the intake line, which in turn depends primarily on the position of the throttle valve. 
 The invention will become more readily apparent from the description of exemplary embodiments presented below on the basis of the accompanying drawings:

" Modularization of broadcast receiver driver components is described herein. A broadcast receiver is composed of one or more component drivers. Each component driver includes one or more control nodes that perform a series of one or more functions to receive a broadcast signal and extract content information from the signal. 
 According to one aspect of the modularization architecture, a broadcast receiver is constructed by connecting multiple control nodes together in order to receive a broadcast signal and extract multimedia content information from the signal. None of the multiple control nodes requires knowledge of the network type via which the signal is being received. Rather, a network module is aware of the network type and configures the control nodes as necessary to carry out their respective functions. 
 According to another aspect of the modularization architecture, the broadcast receiver driver includes an interface that allows a network module to identify, from the driver, what control nodes are included in the driver and what additional interfaces those control nodes include. The network module can thus be developed independently of the broadcast receiver driver and can operate in conjunction with multiple different broadcast receiver drivers. 
 According to another aspect of the invention, additional control nodes can be included in the broadcast receiver driver to support unforeseen changes to the format of the received signal. As each control node is configured by the network module, changes can be made to the operation of the broadcast receiver driver subsequent to development of the driver in order to accommodate such unforeseen changes.

" The present invention provides a trailing edge adjustable weight system for helicopter main rotor blades that overcomes the disadvantages associated with the prior air system of mass balancing rotor blades. The system of the invention enables the addition of a sufficient amount of mass or weight to the rotor blade for the required mass balancing of the rotor blade. The weights are easily accessible, and the impact of the weights on the surrounding structure of the rotor blade is minimized. The modification required of the rotor blade to implement the adjustable weight system is inexpensive, and does not significantly impact the aerodynamics of the rotor blade outer mold line. 
 The system of the invention comprises a plurality of depressions or aft recesses formed into the lower surface of the rotor blade adjacent the blade trailing edge. In the preferred embodiment, three aft recesses are formed into the rotor blade lower surface. A fastener hole is provided in each of the recesses. The fastener hole extends through the rotor blade. 
 A forward weight pocket is also formed into the rotor blade lower surface adjacent the leading edge of the rotor blade, as was done in the prior art. However, because providing weights adjacent the rotor blade trailing edge provides greater flexibility in mass balancing in the chordwise or lateral direction of the rotor blade, only one forward weight pocket is formed in the rotor blade. A balancing weight and a cover plate are provided for the forward weight pocket in a similar manner to that of the prior art. 
 In addition to the forward pocket weight, the system of the invention comprises a plurality of aft weights. Each of the aft weights has a configuration that is complementary to the configuration of the aft recesses. Each of the aft weights has the same configuration or shape, however each of the aft weights can have a different mass. In this manner, the system of the invention provides a great deal of flexibility in adding weight to the trailing edge of the rotor blade. 
 Each of the aft weights are comprised of a molded plastic body having a metallic core. The bodies of the weights are identical in size and shape. Weight variability is achieved by utilizing different size and/or density metallic core inserts in the plastic bodies of the weights. The metallic inserts also incorporate a threaded hole. A retention screw is passed through the hole in the blade recess from the upper surface of the blade and is screw threaded into the threaded hole of the weight to secure the weight in the recess. 
 The system of the invention simplifies the mass balancing of the rotor blade by allowing the spanwise or longitudinal length adjustments to the blade to be performed by removing or adding the forward weight to the single forward weight pocket. Secondly, the system minimizes the quantity of weight required to make a chordwise or lateral weight adjustment. This is due to the greater distance provided between the forward weight and the aft adjustable weights along the lateral width of the blade. The system of the invention also provides the benefit of reducing the size of the aft weights secured in the weight recesses due to the large lateral offset distance between the forward weight pocket and the aft weight recesses. The offset distance between the two sets of weights also enables the elimination of the second forward weight pocket of the prior art. 
 Thus, the system of the invention reduces the total system weight required to achieve the desired mass balance adjustability of the rotor blade. The system also reduces the fabrication costs of the rotor blade assembly by eliminating the necessity for the second forward adjustable weight pocket that was required by the prior art. Still further, the system reduces the level of effort required to perform a mass balancing operation on the rotor blade at the initial manufacturing of the blade as well as throughout the life of the rotor blade assembly.

a rotor blade having a longitudinal length with opposite proximal and distal ends, and opposite leading and trailing edges; and

The method involves depositing a first metal cap layer over the metal-filled interconnect feature in a first deposition process which constitutes electroless metal deposition from an electroless bath comprising a source of metal ions and a reducing agent; and depositing a second metal cap layer over the first metal cap layer in a second deposition process distinct from the first deposition process to thereby form the multilayer metal cap as a permanent component distinct from the metal-filled interconnect feature.

" The invention provides a single mode optical fiber with a large mode field diameter, said fiber having a core and a cladding, and the core of the fiber has an inner core region at least partially doped with a rare-earth dopant and a co-dopant and an outer core region at least partially doped with a dopant, the type and amount of the rare-earth dopant and its co-dopant in the inner core region and of the dopant in the outer core region being adapted to achieve a refractive index in the outer core region which is lower than that of the inner core region so as to produce a large mode field diameter of the fiber, exceeding 5.51 μm at a wavelength of 1550 nm. 
 Thus, the present invention resides in the finding that by subdividing the core profile of a rare-earth doped optical fiber into an inner core region and an outer core region and, with the use of index raising elements, adjusting the refractive index of the outer core region to be lower than the refractive index of the inner core region, one can obtain a fiber with a large mode field diameter exceeding 5.5 m at 1550 nm. This mode field diameter is always larger than the mode field diameter of an equivalent rare-earth doped step index fiber having a single core profile. 
 Moreover, the outer core region may itself be composed of a plurality of sub-regions. For example, it may consist of 1 to 5 regions, each of which may have a different refractive index, provided, however, that the overall effective refractive index of the outer region is lower than that of the inner core region so as to achieve the desired large mode field diameter of the fiber. 
 The ratio of the diameter of the inner core region to the total core diameter is normally greater than 0.1, and preferably in the range from about 0.5 to 0.9. 
 The relative refractive index of the inner core region is normally from about 0.3% to 3% and that of the outer core region from about 0.2% to 2.9%. Thus, the refractive index of the outer core is always lower than that of the inner core region and is so adjusted as to produce the desired large mode field diameter. As is known, when expressed in percent, the relative refractive index is calculated as Δn/n×100, where Δn is the difference between the index of the doped core region and that of silica and n is the refractive index of silica. 
 The inner core region of the fiber in accordance with the present invention is doped at least in part with a rare-earth element such as an oxide of Er, Yb, Nd, Th, Tm or a combination thereof. Preferably, it is doped with Er2O3. The rare-earth dopant is normally present in the molar amount from 10 ppm to 50,000 ppm, depending on the rare-earth element or combination being used. In addition, it has a co-dopant which may be an index raising element, such as an oxide of Al, La, P, Ge, Ti or a combination thereof. Preferably, the co-dopant in the inner core region is Al2O3. Such co-dopant is usually present within the range of 1 mol % to 40 mol %. 
 The outer core region will normally comprise only a dopant that is composed of index raising elements which may be the same or different from those used in the inner core region, but in an amount such as to make the refractive index of the outer core region lower than that of the inner core region. Suitable outer core dopants are, for example, oxides of Al, Ge, Ti, P, La and combinations thereof. The preferred outer core dopant is GeO2 and such dopants are normally used within the range of 3 mol % to 20 mol %. 
 As already mentioned, the outer core region may be formed of a plurality of sub-regions which are doped, at least in part, with index raising elements so that the overall outer core region has a refractive index lower than that of the inner core region. One or more of such sub-regions may have no dopants at all and be made-up of pure silica. Preferably, the outer core region has 1 to 5 regions within its profile. 
 The cladding is usually made of pure silica, but it may also include dopants, if desired. However, the cladding layer in this invention does not contribute to the large field diameter formation of the fiber, which is produced by the dual core profile as described above. 
 The optical fiber of the present invention can be fabricated by any suitable method such as VAD, MCVD or OVD, PCVD or a combination thereof or any other method used to fabricate optical fiber. The preferred method is MCVD.

" According to one aspect of the present invention, a semiconductor laser module includes a semiconductor laser diode, a sub-mount, a stem, and a first and second lead pins. The semiconductor laser diode emits light by supplying a driving signal between these two electrodes. The sub-mount mounts the laser diode and provides a first and second transmission lines. The first transmission line is connected to one electrode of the laser diode, while the second transmission line is connected to the other electrode thereof. The stem includes a disk-shaped base and a block disposed on the base. The block mounts the sub-mount. The first and second lead pins are disposed in the base for inputting a first signal and a second signal, respectively. Preferably, these two signals are complementary to each other. The driving signal supplied to the laser diode is one of the first signal and the second signal. In the optical module of the present invention, the first and second lead pins are directly connected to the first and second transmission lines formed on the sub-mount, respectively. 
 Since lead pins, through which a signal for driving the semiconductor laser diode is provided, are directly connected to transmission lines matched their impedance to a predetermined value and the laser diode is also connected to the transmission lines without the bonding wire, the parasitic inductance attributed to the bonding wire can be removed and the high frequency performance of the laser module can be enhanced.

 The first and second transmission lines may be a microstrip line having predetermined transmission impedance, and may include a resistor, the shape of which may be a thin film resistor or a chip resistor, on a way to the semiconductor laser diode. By equalizing resistance of the resistor to the transmission impedance or approximately to the transmission impedance, the quality of the output optical signal can be enhanced because of reducing the impedance mismatching. 
 Further, one of the transmission line may have a via hole immediately beside the semiconductor laser for electrically connecting the transmission line to the block. Grounding the stem and connecting the one electrode of the semiconductor laser diode to the transmission line having the via hole, the ground potential for the semiconductor laser diode can be stabilized, accordingly, the quality of the output optical signal can be enhanced.

For the optical alignment in directions across the optical axis can be preformed by sliding an assembly of the sleeve, the stub, and the sleeve cover on the end face of the alignment member.

" In view of the foregoing, the disclosed watermark embedding method for digital image data is one that is able to perform subband image processing in the frequency domain. 
 The watermark embedding method based on the DCT subband image character according to the invention contains the following steps. First, a first experience parameter TH1 and a second experience parameter TH2 are determined. The first parameter TH1 can be set by the required image distortion. The second parameter TH2 performs its setting according to thr required image robustness. Afterwards, the frequency image converted from the original image and the binary watermark image series (A1, . . . An) are obtained. The system then extracts the macro-block of the frequency macro-block and reads the binary watermark image data An according to their order. Afterwards, the system performs comparison the parameter combination and their associated errors in the embedded block of the macro-block. The parameter combination with the smallest errors are added and substracted by TH2 (determined by the numerical type) to replace the discrete cosine parameters in the subband of the embedded block. Such parameter setting is performed in each macro-block of the frequency image until the watermark information is completely embedded in the image. 
 With the disclosed method, it is possible to embed and hide the watermark information in the embedded blocks of specific macro-blocks of the frequency image converted from the original image. This cannot only keep the original image intact, but is also able to withstand strong damages. Moreover, the watermark image can be directly extracted without the aid of the original image. Therefore, it is a simple but robust “watermark embedding technique.”

" The present invention provides a method by which a player may use a card or other identification device that they already have in their possession as an identification device for use in accessing a player account in a gaming system. The present invention eliminates the requirement that the gaming facility itself issue a gaming system-specific player identification device, although preferred forms of the invention maintain that option for players who wish to use a special gaming system-specific identification device rather than a identification device the player may already have in their possession for other purposes. 
 An identification device a player already has in their possession independent of the gaming facility or gaming system will be referred to in this disclosure and the accompanying claims as an “external identification device.” The word “external” is intended in this definition to imply that the device is external to any device issued by the gaming facility to act as an account access or system login device. Examples of identification devices that represent external identification devices within the scope of this definition include a driver's license, other identification devices issued by governmental authorities such as military identification cards, identification devices issued by financial institutions such as credit cards or ATM cards, and security cards issued outside of the gaming facility or system. In any case, the external identification device will be encoded in some fashion with identifying information that is generally unique to the card owner. For example, the identifying information on an external identification device according to the invention may be encoded on a magnetic stripe or other magnetic medium on the card or device, stored in an integrated circuit chip included in the device, or encoded in a bar-code or other optically read structure on the device. 
 A gaming system embodying the principles of the invention includes an account assignment station, an account controller, and at least one player interface. The account assignment station and the player interface both include an external identification device reader that is adapted to read external identifying information for a player from an external identification device carried by the player. The account controller is operatively connected to the account assignment station to receive the external identifying information for the player read from the first external identification device reader. The account controller associates a player account for the player with the external identifying information for the player and stores this association. The player interface may be associated with a player station or other device in the gaming system and is also operatively connected to the account controller for communicating to the account controller the external identifying information read by the external identification device reader associated with the player interface. This identifying information communicated to the account controller from the player interface facilitates access to the player account for various purposes associated with the gaming system. 
 A method according to the invention includes first reading external identifying information for player from an external identification device and then associating the external identifying information with a player account in a gaming system. The method further includes reading the external identifying information for the player from a player interface device included the gaming system, and then accessing the player account using the external identifying information read at the player interface device. 
 The present invention also encompasses a program product stored on a computer readable medium. A program product according to the invention includes identifier association program code and account access program code. The identifier association program code receives external identifying information for a player from an external identification device and associates that external identifying information with a player account in a gaming system. The account access program code receives the external identifying information for the player from the player interface at a player station or other system device and accesses the player account using the external identifying information. 
 These and other advantages and features of the invention will be apparent from the following description of preferred embodiments, considered along with the accompanying drawings.
","1. A gaming system including: 
(a) an account assignment station including a first external identification device reader, the first external identification device reader being adapted to read external identifying information for a player from an external identification device;

" The object of the present invention is to provide a biocontrol agent comprising the effective amount of pepper esterase (PepEST) having amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, wherein said effective amount of pepper esterase is 0.05˜0.2 mg per mililiter. The invention relates to the use of the protein with resistance activation in plant. The use means in this context that the formula containing PepEST protein with pathogen controlling action is topically applied to the plant from outside. PepEST protein has primarily decomposed the component of cuticles on pepper fruits. A cutin monomer, 9-octadecenamide, was released from the cuticle. Then, hydrogen peroxide was generated in the unripe fruits where several defense-related genes were subsequently expressed. So, said pepper esterase has the functions for protecting the plant by inducing defense reaction. In this case, said plant is pepper. Further, said pepper esterase dissolves fungal wall, so dithian compound was released from fungus. In addition, the formula containing dithiothreitol (DTT) and the protein fractions showed direct antifungal functions according to the concentrations of said esterase, i) inhibiting the germination of fungal spores; ii) inhibiting fungal penetration into pepper fruits. 
 For the application of pepper esterase, said fungus is Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.

" It is therefore an object of the present invention to deliver a content provided with a modality suited to the abilities and preferences of the user and appropriate for the terminal used by the user, the time of day, and the location such that the user is allowed to view and/or hear the content in an individually effective mode whenever and wherever he or she wants to do so. 
 Accordingly, the present invention allows a content delivery server to select and deliver a content composed of modalities considering the terminal used by the user, the ambient environment including the relationship between the user and the terminal, and the characteristics and preferences of the user and allows the user to view and/or hear an arbitrary content composed of optimum modalities suited to the environment even if he or she changes the location, the time, or the terminal. 
 In addition, the content delivery server is also allowed to deliver minimum required data to the terminal. By preventing the delivery of modalities that cannot be used at the terminal, as has been performed in the conventional examples, a burden on the server and communication equipment can be reduced. 
 A server according to the present invention comprises: an input/output unit for performing transmission and reception of information between itself and a terminal connected thereto; a content management unit for managing a content composed of at least one or more modalities; and a control unit for controlling the input/output unit and the content management unit, wherein the control unit obtains, of attribute information composed of terminal attribute information on an output interface at the terminal, environment attribute information on a current ambient environment of the terminal, and user attribute information on a characteristic of a user using the content by means of the terminal, at least two sets of the attribute information via the input/output unit, generates, based on the obtained attribute information sets, modality construction information specifying modalities to be delivered to the terminal, determines, by using the modality construction information, a modality construction for the content to be delivered which is under the management of the content management unit, and delivers the content composed of the determined modalities to the terminal via the input/output unit, so that the modalities suited to the environment and location of the terminal and to the situation of the user using the terminal are delivered.

" The present invention recognizes that there exists a need in a variety of contexts for an optimized ADSL system that: (i) provides a means to develop CO equipment which does not limit attainable data rate of the access link due to crosstalk (i.e. inadequate isolation between access links within the same operational environment); (ii) provides a means to overcome limits of the current standards with regards to short loops and long loops for high bit rate delivery systems; (iii) provides a means to decrease operational maintenance costs and improve manageability for ADSL network operators; (iv) provides a means to increase the number of subscribers which can be accommodated for high bit rate ADSL data and video delivery systems to improve obtainable revenue for a given monetary investment in physical plant infrastructure; and (v) provides a means to increase subscriber satisfaction for video delivery systems through the improvement of error rates inherent in prior art ADSL systems. 
 As described above, prior art systems may have as many as 6 RJ-21 connections in a typical ADSL signal path between a DSLAM and an outdoor cable loop plant. One embodiment of the present invention implements a number of improvements to reduce the power sum NEXT to a level of −66 dB. Firstly, the number of RJ-21 connectors used is minimized, allowing no more than 3 RJ-21 connections in the ADSL signal path. Secondly, the RJ-21 connectors of the present invention are wired in a novel manner that minimizes pair-to-pair crosstalk that minimizes RJ-21 power sum NEXT. Thirdly, all printed circuit board (PCB) layouts and circuit designs are implemented such that the crosstalk levels are all more than 20 dB below any RJ-21 connector contributions. By using a noise design budget, the connectors and interconnection cables become the limiting components in power sum NEXT contribution of the complete ADSL system. 
 The present invention further recognizes the need for systems and methods that can account for the wide variation in any given outdoor loop plant to optimize the provision of ADSL service irrespective of the characteristics of such loop plant by forcing the transmit levels on adjacent twisted-wire pairs to be the same level. The present invention recognizes that this can be accomplished manually or in an automated manner. 
 Other advantages of the present invention include: (1) the ability to implement optimal transmit level equalization at the ADSL chip, modem, or system level at the customer premise location; (2) the ability to implement a cost effective central office solution by using common system components; (3) lower cost of operation since limitations of ADSL standards can be overcome in an automated fashion; and (4) increased reliability and quality of service since SNR is limited by the outdoor cable loop plant only rather than by the loop plant and the central office equipment.

a multi-conductor cable including a plurality of pairs of wire; 
a connector having a plurality of pins disposed in a first row and a second row, said first row and said second row being parallel; and 
wherein one end of each wire of said multi-conductor cable is terminated on a pin of said connector."

" The present invention provides a method for the prognostic prediction of metastasis. The method comprises identifying the presence or absence of fragile site FRA12E on chromosome 12q24 at the SMRT gene locus. The presence of this fragile site at this locus is indicative of higher likelihood of metastasis than if the fragile site is absent. The presence of this fragile site may be detected by using as probes nucleotide sequences which can hybridize to the 12q24 locus. Examples of nucleotide sequences that can be used as probes include BAC clones (such as SMRT-specific RPC11 BAC clones). 
 In one embodiment, the method for detecting the presence of FRA12E site on chromosome 12 in the 12q24 locus comprises the steps of contacting a genomic DNA sample from an individual with one or more labeled BAC clones which comprise sequences corresponding to the 12q24 region at the SMRT gene locus and determining specific binding of the probes. In a preferred embodiment, the specific binding of the probes is determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). 
 In another aspect of the invention, since the fragile site FRA12E is located within or in close proximity to the SMRT gene, a prognostic evaluation predictive of metastasis can also be carried out by determining the expression of the SMRT protein by immunodetection such as by ELISA, Western blotting, fluorescence labeling and the like.

" An objective of the present invention is to provide a system and method for more effective video coding of non-address attributes as required for automation of mail processing and, in particular, to increase productivity while at the same time decrease operator error rate from existing methods of video coding non-address attributes. An additional objective is that the basic system and method to be described can be application-wise extended beyond the previously mentioned examples of non-address attributes (i.e. stamp classification and endorsement) to include filtering of patterns whether they are structured, such as conventional alphabets, or are an arbitrary grouping of shapes. Yet another objective is to increase the level of work satisfaction of coding operators through exposure to non-keying intensive tasks and ones that use aspects of the operators' cognitive intellect. These and other advantages are made available by the present invention. 
 The present system comprises means for executing the above described inventive method. The present system includes a feeding mechanism for handling the mail pieces, the feeding mechanism comprising means for running mail pieces past a high resolution scanner or similar image lift device. An image, created by the scanner, is forwarded to at least one processor for resolution. In the event the non-address attributes are unresolveable, a second processor and database are consulted for creation of the aforementioned matrix, however, the present matrix includes a Cognitive Zone. The cognitive zone includes example non-address attributes which may match the unresolved non-address attributes. The Cognitive Zone is centrally located and may comprise a single or column entry or row entry. The matrix is then forwarded via appropriate means to one of a plurality of video coding stations for decoding. 
 The present invention also comprises a method for performing non-address attribute resolution using the above mentioned system. According to the present method, an image is created and non-address attributes therein are resolved by automatic means. A determination as to whether Automatic resolution was successful is performed. A successful determination is one that rises above a particular threshold. Unsuccessfully resolved attributes that have a recognition affinity to a given attribute class but where below the successful recognition threshold are assigned to a matrix designated for said attribute class. A cognitive zone made up of example attribute(s) is inserted into the matrix and the matrix forwarded to an encoder for manual encoding. The example attributes in the cognition zone are arrived at by matching the non-resolved attributes with example attributes believed to be a match, the matching rated by level of confidence. Because the confidence level of the initial resolution is not high, it is not always a guarantee that the example attribute displayed in the cognitive zone will match the non-resolved attribute. If the encoder indicates that the non-resolved attribute does not match the example attribute in the cognitive zone, the subject reject attribute is reassessed according to its next highest likelihood recognition and inserted as one of the candidates in a second matrix with a cognitive zone composed of examples related to this new recognition alternative. The present method includes other steps detailed below. 
 When an non-match is indicated, a second matrix is created using example attributes having a next highest match confidence level. The second matrix is presented to the encoder for manual matching. This occurs for additional matrices until the match confidence level falls below a preset threshold; at which time the entire image is presented to encoder for manual encoding.

means for generating the image; 
means for resolving the non-address attributes; and

" The present invention provides an improved method for hydraulically fracturing an entire earth formation that has more than one zone having different Fracture Gradients and different stress gradients. The number of zones is pre-determined by the operator and is typically based on the well log and on the operator's experience. 
 In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, the well stimulation process is divided into a “Diagnostics” stage and a “Fracture Treatment” stage. During the Diagnostics stage, which would typically last about one and one-half hours in the following examples, the initial ISIP is taken to determine the Fracture Gradient of the rock zone with the lowest stress. The lowest stress rock is the easiest to induce fractures, hence it takes the fluid first. Once the Fracture Gradient is determined, a large volume of treated water is pumped into the formation at a pre-determined rate to initiate stimulation, or ensure that the zone is open and ready to receive the Fracture Treatment. Ball sealers are then introduced into the well to block the perforations in this first zone and direct further fluids to the zone with the next higher stress. 
 The above referenced process is repeated until each different zone within the formation is identified and either the corresponding perforations are sealed with ball sealers and/or stimulation in the zone is initiated. If the ISIP is different from one zone to the next (a difference in the Fracture Gradient of 0.02 psi/ft is indicative for diversion), then that confirms that fluids are reaching other parts of the formation and, thus, the process is effective. After the process has been repeated for each zone, then the wellbore is opened and closed repeatedly to atmospheric pressure “surging” the balls, allowing sufficient flowback for all of the balls to be unseated simultaneously and either fall to the bottom of the well or rise to the surface. 
 Once the balls are removed from the perforations at the formation, the Fracture Treatment phase is initiated. 
 This process of the present invention can be utilized in acid jobs, energized fluid jobs, and any fluid stimulation treatment that is water-based or hydrocarbon-based regardless of whether it contains any kind of proppant. The diversion can be used at any time during the pumping process of treatment: beginning, middle, or end. The fluid following diversion can be any stimulation fluid, regardless of whether it is water-based, hydrocarbon-based, energized fluid, or acid, regardless of whether it contains any kind of proppant. The diverter itself can be any ball sealer, whether biodegradable or not, rock salt, wax beads, proppant, benzoic acid flakes, foam-based fluids, gelled and ungelled aqueous-based fluids, or other kind of material used specifically for diversion from a rock of lower stress gradient to a rock of higher stress gradient. Further, the diverter is not limited to being used inside the pipe and wellbore. This process also includes the above mentioned diverters used for diversion outside the pipe in-the-formation.

The torsional-vibration damper also includes a friction device having a plurality of fiction blocks that are each operatively supported between the primary element and the secondary element such that the friction blocks provide frictional contact between the primary element and the secondary element. 
 One advantage of the torsional-vibration damper of the present invention is that the friction device is simple and inexpensive to produce. 
 Another advantage of the torsional-vibration damper of the present invention is that the by varying the size of the friction elements the predetermined relative friction moment force of the friction device is easily changeable in production. 
 Another advantage of the torsional-vibration damper of the present invention is that it requires few separate components. 
 Other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will be readily appreciated, as the same becomes better understood while reading the subsequent description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

a primary element operatively connected for rotation with the power take off of a prime mover; 
a secondary element operatively connected for rotation with the input to a transmission; 
a spring mechanism operatively disposed between said primary element and said secondary element that is adapted to operatively couple said primary element to said secondary element in a damped torque translational relationship; and

" An improved optical system, as disclosed herein, provides for a real image of an object to appear and disappear by changing the relative orientation between a first and second optical polarizer. For instance, special effects design engineers for studios or movie houses may utilize this improved optical system for producing a real image of an object, such as a floating ghost, that conveniently disappears and reappears. 
 In one aspect, an improved real image system includes a container and a set of first and second polarizers. The first polarizer has a first transmissive axis, which transmits light that vibrates in the same plane as the first transmissive axis. Light aligned along the first transmissive axis passes through the first polarizer and through an opening in the container. Light though the opening travels to a second polarizer. 
 The second polarizer has a second transmissive axis that transmits light vibrating in the same plane as the second transmissive axis. The second polarizer blocks, reflects, or transmits light traveling from the first polarizer depending on relative orientations of the first transmissive axis and the second transmissive axis. Light received aligned with the second transmissive axis passes though the second polarizer, and continues to travel to the object and a reflective surface below the object. The reflected light from the object aligned with the second transmissive axis travels back through the opening to the first polarizer. Light is transmitted through the first polarizer to produce a real image of the object depending on the relative orientation of the first transmissive axis to the second transmissive axis. 
 If the first transmissive axis and the second transmissive axis are oriented substantially orthogonal, the effect is disappearance of the real image of the object. If the first transmissive axis and the second transmissive axis are substantially parallel to each other, the effect is appearance of the real image of the object. 
 In yet another aspect, the rotation of a relative orientation of the first transmissive axis to the second transmissive axis controls visibility of the real image of the object. The effect is that a user can gradually transition from a visible to an invisible state by rotating the first transmissive axis relative to the second transmissive axis. In this aspect, the real image of the object will maintain its true color image. The polarizers will provide a clear color for maintaining the surrounding background of the object. 
 Other applications may include convenience stores, train stations, or other locations where a floating real image of an object is displayed periodically. In another example, during the filming of a scary movie, a floating real image of an object mysteriously appears from a puff of smoke to create an illusion of a frightening spirit or apparition. In another application, the improved optical system provides a floating real image of an object magically appearing near a mountain or a tree-lined street for passing observer.

Many substitutions, modifications, additions and/or rearrangements may be made within the scope of the invention without departing from the spirit thereof, and the invention includes all such substitutions, modifications, additions and/or rearrangements.
","1.

" An object of the invention is to provide a safe and reliable wound closure device not causing problems to the patient. 
 This is achieved in a wound closure device for closing a wound in a vessel, comprising a first sealing device adapted to be positioned against the inner surface of the vessel wall and a fastener adapted to keep the first sealing device in place. Where the first sealing device is made of a material that dissolves by means of physical processes. 
 Hereby tissue ingrowth and cell adhesion is minimal or substantially does not occur as the seal surface is being eroded and/or dissolved away continuously. In other words, the seal surface is being constantly peeled off by the blood flow. Hereby there is no risk that the seal becomes larger and limits the blood flow. 
 Preferably the material dissolves fast, suitably in less than seven days. 
 Hereby the seal dissolves inside the vessel (or outside the vessel in the case of an extra-arterial occluder) after a few days and the seal is not left inside the vessel an unnecessary long time. This gives a safe seal since the inflammatory risk is reduced with a short dissolution time. Furthermore, with a short dissolution time parts of the seal that accidentally come loose in the blood flow will soon be dissolved and would not cause any problems for the patient in this short time. The adherence of cells and tissues on the seal is also even more unlikely when the material dissolves fast. 
 The sealing devices are generally hydrolytically stable and do not chemically or biologically degrade in the functional use of the sealing device. Herein, the terms “dissolve”, “dissolution” or “dissolvable” refer to a process in which physical interactions between molecules are broken, without breaking of covalent bonds as the molecules, typically polymer chains, swell and dissolve into the surrounding medium, such as the aqueous media within and external to vessels. Swelling and dissolution in aqueous media outside the body can be used as an in vitro test to simulate the in vivo dissolution. This is in contrast to the known sealing devices described above, which degrade at least partly by means of biological and/or chemical processes, in which chemical bonds, usually covalent bonds, within a single polymer or between polymer molecules need to be broken before the dissolution process can commence. 
 The present invention overcomes the disadvantages of having an unnecessarily long degradation time encountered in arterial sealing devices made of an absorbable material that at least partly degrades by means of biological and/or chemical processes. The invention provides a sealing device that can be made of a material that dissolves inside a vessel (or outside the vessel in the case of an extra-arterial occluder) by physical processes. This reduces the time during which the sealing device is present in the body to a few days.

" The present invention provides a system and method for obtaining an accurate reading of a utility meter. Additionally, the present invention provides a system and method for determining tampering with utility meters and theft of electricity. 
 Briefly described, in architecture, the system can be implemented as follows. The present invention utilizes a reflective tape affixed to the rotating disk of a utility meter. This reflective tape is constructed so as to have sections of highly reflective material and non-reflective material, separated by clearly defined edges. Thus, the difference between the reflective areas and the non-reflective areas provides a high degree of contrast and facilitates the “readability” of the tape. As the disk rotates with the use of electricity, the tape is “read” by an optical sensor that is connected to a circuit card. The circuit card is retrofittably mounted in available space within the utility meter so that the optical sensor aligns with the tape as it is carried through its revolutions. By “reading” the passage of the reflective and non-reflective sections of the tape, the consumption of electricity and the rotational direction of the disk can be accurately determined. The consumption data is then communicated to the circuit card and then transmitted to the utility company. 
 The present invention can also be viewed as providing a method for retrofitting existing utility meters so as to obtain more accurate meter readings and detect unauthorized use or tampering with utility meters. In this regard, the method can be broadly summarized by the following steps: applying a light-weight, highly-reflective tape, such as mylar tape, to the rotating disk of a utility meter and installing an optical sensor and circuit card in such a manner that the optical sensor aligns with and “reads” the tape as it is carried through its revolution on the disk. The reflective tape is marked with sections of non-reflective material and the contrast between these sections is “read” by the optical sensor and the results communicated to the circuit card. The consumption data is then transmitted to the utility company for analysis and monitoring.

It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features, and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the present invention, and be protected by the accompanying claims.

" The present invention provides a security label, a secured article for increasing tamper resistance and an associated method. An embodiment according to a first aspect of the invention includes a label that can overlay confidential information, and selectively block access to that confidential information during use. In particular, the label may include an obscuring layer operable to overlay the confidential information to hide or maintain the confidential nature of the confidential information until the obscuring layer is removed. 
 An embodiment according to a second aspect of the invention includes a label that can overlay information and block or reduce access to the information while maintaining viewing access to the information. In particular, the second aspect label includes a film that may be transparent, that is, through which the information may be viewed, but may not be physically accessed or altered. 
 The labels of both the first and second aspects include an adhesive layer that can adhere to a substrate to form the secure article. The adhesive layer may include a structural adhesive. The presence of the structural adhesive ensures that an initial removal of the adhesive layer from a surface, for example, precludes re-adherence using the adhesive layer. 
 The adhesive layer can further have initial pressure sensitive adhesive properties. The pressure sensitive adhesive properties allow for a general ease-of-application or ease-of-manufacture such that a film or layer can be mounted on the substrate and initially held by the pressure sensitive adhesive properties. The structural adhesive properties form subsequent to initial application and permanently or strongly adhere the film or layer to the substrate. 
 The initial pressure sensitive adhesive properties and the subsequent structural adhesive properties can be obtained in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention by admixing a pressure sensitive adhesive with a structural adhesive to form a dual adhesive system. The system is initially a pressure sensitive adhesive with a latent structural adhesive, and through a predetermined method, the structural adhesive properties are realized. 
 In one embodiment, the latent structural adhesive is an anaerobically curable or cured adhesive. A transition metal compound, for example, organocopper ions can be used to initiate a switch from a latent state to a cured state in the anaerobic environment. In alternative embodiments, rather than using two different adhesives, a single adhesive with a dual cure system can be used. In yet other embodiments, an article can also include the substrate itself and/or additional layers, such as print layers, tie layers, and the like. 
 The presence of structural adhesive properties increases the tamper resistance and/or tamper evidencing properties of an article in accordance with the invention. Access to information, use of an embossed seal, and maintaining or protecting the confidential nature of information until accessed by the rightful consumer is controlled. Tampering, fraud and the like can be reduced or minimized. Alternatively, if tampering occurs, tampering is evident and the consumer or user is forewarned of such tampering.

" It is an object of the invention to provide a slip-preventing device for a tire that enables anyone to fit it on a tire in a short time. 
 According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a slip-preventing device comprising a plurality of arm frames having a shape contacting with an inner sidewall, a tread and an outer sidewall of a tire and a link unit provided at an outer side of the tire. The link unit links the arm frames with each other. With such features, the slip-preventing device can be made into the simplest structure. The slip-preventing device can be held on the tire by itself by connecting the arm frames. That is, the slip-preventing device is continuous at the inner sidewall, the tread and the outer sidewall of the tire, so that it never physically comes off the tire. At the time of gripping by rotating the tire, a weight of a vehicle is applied to a portion of the arm frame that touches a ground surface of a road. Particularly, a width of the tire enlarges to inside and outside directions, thereby increasing a force to hold the arm frame on the tire. A set of the arm frames are linked at the inner sidewall, the tread and the outer sidewall so as to round the tire. Consequently, the set of the arm frames as a whole absorbs vibration. Moreover, the arm frames become in a centripetal state so that there arises friction at the portion of the arm frame that touches the ground surface, thereby acting as the slip-preventing device. 
 The slip-preventing device of the tire may provide a free joint unit on the arm frame. In this case, the free joint unit defines a connecting portion and functions to move in the arm frame. Thus, the free joint unit releases a force applied to the arm frame or vibration at the time of rotating the tire or braking. Moreover, the free joint serves to facilitate installation to the tire. 
 The slip-preventing device of the tire may have an elastic body fitted on the free joint unit in the arm frame. In this case, the elastic body is composed of a spring, rubber or the like. When the elastic body is fitted on the free joint unit, it facilitates much more the installation to the tire and improves much more the absorption of the vibration or noise. Particularly, using them in combination improves much more the performance of the slip-preventing device. 
 According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided. 
 Further objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, wherein preferred embodiments of the invention are clearly shown.

That is, whether a persistent overload caused a thermal trip, or whether the breaker tripped in response to an instantaneous magnetic trip caused by an overcurrent. As another aspect of the invention, a surge detector is incorporated into the circuit breaker and the monitor includes an indicator to indicate the surge condition. The type of trip and surge indications can be presented at the circuit breaker, such as by light emitting diodes, or can be communicated to a remote location.

The circuit breaker further comprises a monitor providing a thermal trip indication when the separable contacts are opened by the thermal trip and providing a magnetic trip indication when the separable contacts are opened by the magnetic trip. The thermal/magnetic trip device can comprise a bimetal heated by current passing through the separable contacts. The monitor can comprise a trip sensor sensing opening of the separable contacts, a temperature sensor sensing temperature of the bimetal, a processor generating a thermal trip signal in response to a sensed temperature above a selected value when the separable contacts open, and output means generating the thermal trip indication in response to the thermal trip signal. The monitor can further comprise a current sensor sensing current through the separable contacts and the processor can generate a magnetic trip signal in response to a sensed current signal above a selected value when the separable contacts open. In this instance, the output means generates the magnetic trip indication in response to the magnetic trip signal. The output means can comprise, for example, a thermal trip light emitting diode generating the thermal trip indication and a magnetic trip light emitting diode generating the magnetic trip indication. The output means can also comprise communication means for communicating the thermal trip indication and the magnetic trip indication remotely. 
 The trip unit can further comprise electronic trip circuitry generating an electronic trip signal indicating at least one of an arc fault and a ground fault, and a trip actuator responsive to the electronic trip signal to actuate the operating mechanism. In this case, the monitor provides at least one of an arc fault trip indication and a ground fault trip indication in response to the electronic trip signal. 
 Where the electronic circuitry includes both an arc fault trip circuit and a ground fault trip circuit, the monitor provides indications of these two types of trips. The monitor can further comprise a surge detector detecting surges in the voltage in the electric power distribution system and can provide an indication of the surge. The monitor can include an output means that can provide a failure to trip indication in response to an arc fault or ground fault signal in the absence of a tripped indication from the trip sensor.

" In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, a method and apparatus for refrigeration system control utilizing electronic evaporator pressure regulators and a floating suction pressure set point is disclosed. To achieve the above objects of the present invention, the present method and apparatus employs electronic stepper regulators (ESR) instead of mechanical evaporator pressure regulators. The method and apparatus may also utilize temperature display modules at each case that can be configured to collect case temperature, product temperature and other temperatures. The display modules are daisy-chained together to form a communication network with a master controller that controls the electric stepper regulators and the suction pressure set point. The communication network utilized can either be a RS-485 or other protocol, such as LonWorks from Echelon. 
 In this regard, the data is transferred to the master controller where the data is logged, analyzed and control decisions for the ESR valve position and suction pressure set points are made. The master controller collects the case temperature for all the cases in a given circuit, takes average/min/max (based on user configuration) and applies PI/PID/Fuzzy Logic algorithms to decide the ESR valve position for each circuit. Alternatively, the master controller may collect liquid sub-cooling or relative humidity information to control the ESR valve position for each circuit. The master controller also controls the suction pressure set point for the rack which is adaptively changed, such that the set point is adjusted in such a way that at least one ESR valve is always kept substantially 100% open.

An electronic evaporator pressure regulator is in communication with each circuit with each electronic evaporator pressure regulator operable to control the temperature of each circuit. A sensor is in communication with each circuit and is operable to measure a parameter from each circuit.

" It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method and a circuit arrangement for wireless data transmission, which can achieve comparatively high transmission rates with improved utilization of the available bandwidth and permit a long transmission range. 
 In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the modulation signal during the modulation period is a noise signal. The method for producing a delimiter, according to a preferred embodiment, results in sidebands with only a small amount of energy, which lie far outside the useful spectrum, and thus can be filtered out easily. The limitation of the transmission rate caused by the sidebands is thus largely eliminated. Moreover, a short modulation period can be chosen so that the time periods during which the carrier signal is blanked can be kept short. This increases the achievable transmission range. The method can be used with amplitude modulation and/or phase modulation. The circuit arrangement according to the invention is particularly suitable for carrying out the method. 
 In a further development of the invention, the average value of the noise signal over time is constant. 
 In a further development of the invention, the modulation signal has the same modulation states before and after a change. In this way, for example, it is possible to simulate on-off keying that has a narrower usable bandwidth than when it is produced conventionally. 
 In a further development of the invention, the modulation signal has different modulation states before and after the change. In this way, for example, it is possible to simulate double sideband modulation that has no interfering sidebands. 
 In a further development of the invention, a random number sequence is generated to produce the noise signal, and this number sequence is converted into the noise signal by a digital-to-analog converter. This makes it possible to generate a noise signal in a simple and cost-effective manner. A random number sequence is advantageously generated using a linear feedback shift register or a chaotic counter. A chaotic counter is a component that outputs a chaotic sequence of values beginning with a start value. For example, a chaotic counter can be constructed as a ripple counter whose power consumption is small. The random number sequence can also be calculated once and stored in a storage area of the base station. For example, the calculation can take place on a conventional personal computer. In this way, generation of the random number sequence at run time can be eliminated, saving the circuit components required for this purpose. 
 In a further development of the circuit arrangement, the modulation signal generation unit comprises a linear feedback shift register or a chaotic counter for generating a random number sequence and a digital-to-analog converter for converting the random number sequence into the noise signal. 
 Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter.

" Ultra-short optical ablation systems can be operated more efficiently when pulse-energy is controlled by varying the ablation pulse repetition rate. The present invention provides a method of generating an ultra-short pulse in a ring oscillator, (sub-picosecond) pulses at very-high frequency repetition rates, which allows pulse selection to be used to accurately vary such very high ablation pulse repetition rates. The oscillator may include an amplifier (e.g., a Semiconductor Optical Amplifier (SOA)), an output coupler, a compressor (e.g., a chirped fiber Bragg grating with an associated circulator), a nonlinear optical element (e.g., a saturable absorber, such as a carbon nanotube saturable absorber), a stretcher (e.g., a chirped fiber Bragg grating with an associated circulator) arranged in a ring configuration to provide ultra-short (sub-picosecond) pulses of repetition rates of 25 MHz to 1 GHz or more. Note that the components can be connected together using optical fiber. Other embodiments of the present invention may have an ablation pulse repetition rate of between about 1 MHz and 25 MHz. The oscillator of the present invention has relatively few components, is relatively inexpensive, can be easily miniaturized, and is also useful for other systems. 
 More specifically, the present invention provides a method of generating an ultra-short pulse in a ring oscillator by amplifying a series of wavelength-swept-with time pulses using one or more amplifiers, compressing the amplified wavelength-swept-with time pulses, reducing the compressed pulses to sub-picosecond pulses, stretching the sub-picosecond pulses into wavelength-swept-with time pulses and returning the stretched pulses to the one or more amplifiers. The one or more amplifiers may include one or more semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs). 
 The oscillator may also include an electrical impulse generator (EIG) to drive the amplifier (or drive an electro-optic modulator) and/or a polarization controller to provide cleaner pulses. The electrical impulse generator can be used to activate a device in the ring to synchronize the oscillator and the pulse selector (e.g., the electrical impulse generator may be used to activate the SOA), or the electrical impulse generator may be used to activate an electro-optic modulator to produce a temporal window of net positive pulse amplification within the ring. 
 The compressing may be preformed by one or more gratings, the stretching may be preformed by one or more gratings, or both the compressing and the stretching may be preformed by one grating or more than one grating. For example, the compressor and stretcher can be a single grating having a circulator connected to each end of the grating. The grating can be a chirped fiber Bragg grating. 
 Generally, the output pulses from the ring oscillator are coupled out through an output coupler (e.g., a portion of each of the amplified pulses is coupled out through the output coupler; either stretched or compressed pulses may be coupled out through the output coupler). A pulse selector may be used to give a pulse-selector output with a repetition rate of less than one-tenth the oscillator repetition rate.

" The current invention provides for a method of identification and quantification of primary amine(s) or secondary amine(s) in a sample by isotope dilution mass spectrometry. The stable isotope labeled internal standard(s) of said amine(s) is synthesized beforehand by reacting a sample containing the analyzed amine(s) with a labeled reagent. Following this step, said stable isotope labeled internal standard(s) is then added to a sample containing the analyzed amine(s). The analyzed amine(s) is then converted to a non labeled analog(s) of said labeled internal standard(s) with identical chemical structure as said labeled internal standard(s) except for the stable isotope atoms using a non-labeled reagent. Both converted analyzed amine(s) and its corresponding said stable isotope labeled internal standard(s) are then extracted and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The stable isotope labeled internal standard(s) provided in the current invention are labeled amide(s), carbamate(s), urea(s) and thiourea(s) analogs of said analyzed amine(s). The type of labeled internal standard(s) used will dictate the labeled reagents used for its synthesis as well as the non-labeled reagent used to convert the analyzed amine(s) to the corresponding analog(s). 
 In comparison with the traditional method of isotope dilution mass spectrometric analysis of more than one amines, the invented method offers the following advantages: 

 1. The efficiency and simplicity of the above reactions makes possible the short, reliable, and quick synthesis of individual stable isotope labeled internal standards, whereas in the traditional method of analysis, stable isotope labeled internal standard of each amine has to be independently synthesized. 
 2. It is possible to quickly and efficiently synthesize a library of stable isotope internal standards for the analysis of an entire library of amines using these reactions and only one commercially available stable isotope labeled reagent. 
 3. Because the synthesis of stable isotope labeled internal standard in this invented method is usually a one-step synthesis, the entire process of synthesis and sample preparation can be performed in an automated fashion. The internal standard is prepared in one step, excess isotope reagent is then destroyed, and the prepared internal standard can be added directly to the samples without purification. The non-labeled reagent is added and the sample is ready for extraction shortly thereafter. 

 These attractive features make the method suitable for high throughput analysis of amines by isotope dilution mass spectrometry.

a) combining a known amount of an amide internal standard with said sample comprising said amine;

c) extracting said sample to isolate said amide and said amide internal standard; and

" It is therefore an object to provide sleeping devices solving the above mentioned problems. 
 This is obtained by a sleeping device, such as a pillow, mattress or quilt, wherein the sleeping device comprises a first layer of a material having temperature regulating properties adapted for minimising temperature variations and a second layer of down filling. 
 By using a material with temperature regulating properties together with a layer of down filling, very good properties of minimizing temperature variations are obtained. Compared to e.g. fiber filling, down filling has very good moist absorbing properties, and by minimizing the moist tests have shown that the functionality of temperature regulating materials such as e.g. phase change materials is improved considerably. Thereby the temperature regulating material can be used to fulfill the quite strict requirement to temperature variation which is necessary to get an undisturbed sleep—and especially an undisturbed REM sleep. Further, by using the temperature regulating material in the sleeping device it is avoided that the user gets sick, both because a better sleep improves the immune system and because the risk of the person unintentionally kicking of the quilt or making the sleeping devices wet because of sweat is reduced. Further, since the risk of the sleeping device getting sweaty is reduced, the frequency of which the sleeping devices and/or sleeping device covers have to be cleaned can be reduced. 
 In an embodiment the temperature regulating material comprises a phase change material. This material has proven to be a good material to be used in sleeping devices and can be adapted to optimally minimise the temperature variations in temperature ranges around the human body temperature. 
 In an embodiment the sleeping device comprises a tick defining the outer surface of the sleeping device, wherein the tick on the inside is directly followed by said first layer of temperature regulating material. Thereby the temperature regulating material is very close to the human body during use. The tick is separating the body from the temperature regulating material both in order to protect the temperature regulating material and to ensure that the down stays inside the sleeping device. 
 In a specific embodiment the tick defines two outer surfaces, which can be used as the surface being in contact with a user, and wherein the tick is directly followed by said first layer of temperature regulating material on the inside of one of the outer surfaces. Thereby the user can choose how much the temperature variations should be minimized. If the material is closer to the user than the down filling, then the temperature variations are smaller than when the sleeping device is turned around and the down filling is closer to the user than the temperature controlling material. 
 In an embodiment the tick comprising the first layer of temperature regulating material is split into channels by splitting walls. This is an easy way of designing the sleeping device, and down filling can afterwards be put Into the channels based on user needs and on around which temperature magnitude the temperature variations are to be minimized.

 Since the ring does not expand as much as the impeller body as the turbocharger heats up, the point of grip between the impeller and the insert remains within the axial extent of the ring during the whole operating cycle of the turbocharger, thereby preventing the tendency of the impeller to “walk” along the insert. As a consequence, the operating life of the turbocharger can be considerably extended in comparison with the conventional turbocharger without the constraining ring. 
 The constraining ring can be fitted onto the impeller body by heating the ring to permit it to be slid onto a circular land, which may be in the form of a step on the impeller hub. Cooling then causes the ring to grip the hub. However, it is not necessary for the ring to exert a high compressive force on the impeller body; its function is to constrain expansion of the impeller relative to the insert, due either to the effects of centrifugal stresses or to thermal expansion. Indeed, it is possible for the ring to have a slight clearance on the assembly when in the cold state, exerting no significant grip. It would then be sufficient to warm the ring to allow it to slip over the impeller more easily on assembly. 
 It has been found that an additional benefit of the use of the constraining ring is that the torque transmitting capability of the joint is increased. This has a major benefit to the rotating assembly, especially if the design is to be used in a mini turbine, where strong fault torques may be transmitted through the rotor shaft. 
 The invention also provides an impeller for a turbocharger, comprising a hub of a first material and an insert that is an interference fit in the hub for receipt of a shaft of the turbocharger, the insert comprising a second material of greater strength than the first material, the hub having mounted thereon a constraining ring of a material having greater strength and a lower coefficient of thermal expansion than the first material, the ring surrounding at least a part of an axial length of the impeller that overlies the insert, thereby to maintain the interference between the insert and the impeller during use of the turbocharger over its operating speed and temperature range. 
 Further aspects of the invention will be apparent from a perusal of the following specific description and the accompanying claims.

A turbocharger having an impeller, the impeller being formed of a first material and being mounted on a turbocharger shaft by means of an insert that is an interference fit in the impeller, the insert comprising a second material of greater strength than the first material, and a constraining ring comprising a material having greater strength and a lower coefficient of thermal expansion than the first material, the constraining ring surrounding at least a part of an axial length of the impeller that overlies the insert, thereby to maintain the interference between the insert and the impeller during use of the turbocharger over its operating speed and temperature range."

" In one embodiment of the present invention, a dispenser assembly is disclosed. The dispenser assembly is adapted to contain a replaceable soap reservoir. At the bottom of the replaceable soap reservoir is a stem valve. A cylindrical pump is situated below the stem valve. The replaceable soap reservoir contains a gel soap that foams at atmospheric pressure, and an inert gas that serves as a propellant. The dispenser assembly contains a stem valve actuator and a cylindrical pump actuator to activate the stem valve and cylindrical pump respectively. The assembly further contains a motor that provides motion to the stem valve actuator and the cylindrical pump actuator through a reduction gear. A printed circuit board is also present in the assembly and operatively connects to, the sensor and motor. The printed circuit board controls the dispenser. 
 The circuit is designed to actuate the motor when the presence of a hand is sensed by the sensor assembly. When actuated, the motor rotates the reduction gear, which in turn moves the stem valve actuator and cylindrical pump actuator. When the stem valve actuator moves, it tilts the stem valve in relation to the bottle. The tilting opens the valve, allowing the contents of the reservoir to be in communication with a piston chamber within the cylindrical pump. Simultaneously, the cylindrical pump opens to allow the piston chamber to be in communication with the atmosphere. 
 The dispenser control logic is designed to accurately dispense the same amount of gel during every use of the dispenser. This logic can have several different embodiments. In the first potential embodiment, the logic is pre-programmed to periodically lengthen the time the dispenser remains open during the lifetime of a reservoir, so that a reduction in pressure in the reservoir does not affect the amount of soap dispensed during the operation of the dispenser. A second embodiment allows for the logic to determine whether an appropriate amount of doses were dispensed for a reservoir, and adjust the dispensing times for the next reservoir. In a third embodiment, the dispenser contains diodes and emitters which detect the level of soap in the reservoir. In this embodiment, the dispenser adjusts the opening time during the lifetime of the reservoir, so that the amount of gel dispensed during each use is consistent. In another embodiment, the logic depends on user input. The logic lengthens the open time when the sensor detects two requests within a predetermined timeframe. Conversely, the logic shortens the open time when no immediately consecutive requests are made in the last ten uses. In these ways, the soap is dispensed in consistent, accurate doses. 
 In an additional embodiment, the dispenser contains an installation positioning sensor. This sensor aids in the installation by indicating the appropriate height of installation above a counter or other surface. 
 In another embodiment, a dispenser is disclosed that does not rely upon sensors or motors to actuate the dispenser. In this embodiment, the dispenser is actuated by the user turning a lever or engaging a button. The lever or button moves the stem valve actuator and the cylindrical pump through the reduction gear, and soap is ejected. As a result, the dispenser requires less energy consumption.

" We have now found that it is possible to apply a gas-barrier layer onto the first side of a first layer which carries a protective layer on the second side of the first layer, and to transfer the protective layer onto the gas-barrier layer. 
 The protective layer may be used to provide one or more desirable properties to the film. For example, the protective layer may provide easier sealability and/or printability, alternatively, the protective layer may provide improved barrier against water and/or gases, improved printability, improved resistance to scratches, and improved optical properties. For a structure in which the gas-barrier layer is a metal layer such as an aluminum layer, the presence of the protective layer reduces the exposure of the metal layer to oxygen. 
 The techniques of the present invention also simplify the manufacture of multi-layer films and can allow some of the current laminates of two or more films to be replaced by a monofilm or by a laminate having fewer layers but equivalent or better properties. The techniques according to this invention also allow films of comparable barrier properties to be produced with fewer layers and fewer manufacturing steps. Accordingly, manufacture is simplified and the associated costs reduced. 
 In one embodiment, the invention can provide a process for the production of a multi-layer film in which the gas-barrier layer is an aluminum layer in which the aluminum layer is protected by the protective layer before it contacts atmospheric oxygen. In such embodiment, the aluminum layer can undergo less oxidation than the degree of oxidation that takes place in the standard manufacture of metallized film. This reduced oxidation of the aluminum layer can result in an aluminum layer of higher purity which can provide better barrier properties for a given amount of aluminum deposited.

" Such known photoconductors are susceptible to carrier injection from the substrate into the photosensitive layer such that the charge on the surface of the photoconductor may be microscopically dissipated or decayed.

" The present invention is a method of using a mobile unit in a multi-cell communication system to determine whether to commence handover of the mobile unit from a serving base station located in a first cell of the communication system to a target base station located in a second cell of the communication system. The mobile unit determines the serving base station received signal code power (RSCPser), the first cell interference signal code power (ISCPser), the target base station received signal code power (RSCPtar) and the second cell interference signal code power (ISCPtar). If the ratio RSCPser/ISCPser is less than the ratio RSCPtar/ISCPtar, the mobile unit commences handover to the target base station. The multi-cell communication system may be a time division duplex (TDD) system. The mobile unit may send a message to a radio network controller (RNC) in communication with the serving and target base stations to initiate the handover. 
 The system utilizes a new criteria and method for initiating handover between cells. The system measures the downlink interference in the BCH timeslot, and utilizes this interference in conjunction with the signal strength as criterion for the handover decision. The new criterion may be used instead of, or in addition to, existing criteria. 
 Accordingly, the ratio of the signal strength of the BCH to the interference in the timeslot may be used to make the handover decision. In one embodiment of the present invention, the signal strength is used in macro cells where interference is relatively predictable and BCH reception is easy. The ratio of signal strength to the interference may be used in pico cells and micro cells. 
 An advantage of using both signal strength and interference measured in the same slot as handover criterion is the inherent inaccuracy of each of the measurements that results from a use of an inaccurate automatic gain control (AGC) circuit. As both signal level and interference are determined at once, their ratio is more accurate than each alone.

" RFC 1155, Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets, describes the common structures and identification scheme for the definition of management information used in managing TCP/IP-based internets. Included are descriptions of an object information model for network management along with a set of generic types used to describe management information. Formal descriptions of the structure are given using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1). 
 RFC 1212, Concise Management Information Base (MIB) Definitions, describes a straight-forward approach toward producing concise, yet descriptive, MIB modules. It is intended that all future MIB modules be written in this format. The Internet-standard SMI employs a two-level approach towards object definition. An MIB definition consists of two parts: a textual part, in which objects are placed into groups, and an MIB module, in which objects are described solely in terms of the ASN.1 macro OBJECT-TYPE, which is defined by the SMI. 
 Management information is viewed as a collection of managed objects, residing in a virtual information store, termed the MIB. Collections of related objects are defined in MIB modules. These modules are written using an adapted subset of OSI's ASN.1. RFC 2578, SMI Version 2 (SMIv2), defines that adapted subset and assigns a set of associated administrative values. 
 The SMI defined in RFC 2578 is divided into three parts: module definitions, object definitions, and, notification definitions. Module definitions are used when describing information modules. An ASN.1 macro, MODULE-IDENTITY, is used to concisely convey the semantics of an information module. Object definitions are used when describing managed objects. An ASN.1 macro, OBJECT-TYPE, is used to concisely convey the syntax and semantics of a managed object. Notification definitions are used when describing unsolicited transmissions of management information. An ASN.1 macro, NOTIFICATION-TYPE, is used to concisely convey the syntax and semantics of a notification. 
 RFC 2579, Textual Conventions for SMIv2, defines an initial set of textual conventions available to all MIB modules. Management information is viewed as a collection of managed objects, residing in a virtual information store, termed the MIB. Collections of related objects are defined in MIB modules. These modules are written using an adapted subset of OSI's ASN.1, termed the SMI defined in RFC 2578. When designing an MIB module, it is often useful to define new types similar to those defined in the SMI. In comparison to a type defined in the SMI, each of these new types has a different name, a similar syntax, but a more precise semantics. These newly defined types are termed textual conventions, and are used for the convenience of humans reading the MIB module. Objects defined using a textual convention are always encoded by means of the rules that define their primitive type. However, textual conventions often have special semantics associated with them. As such, an ASN.1 macro, TEXTUAL-CONVENTION, is used to concisely convey the syntax and semantics of a textual convention. 
 RFC 2580, Conformance Statements for SMIv2, defines the notation used to define the acceptable lower-bounds of implementation, along with the actual level of implementation achieved, for management information associated with the managed objects. 
 Network elements need a way to define managed resources and access/manage those resources in a consistent and transparent way. GDMO does not provide a straight forward approach to defining resources. SMI does not provide for an object-oriented design of network management applications. Neither standard provides sufficient complexity of hierarchy or sufficient complexity of control for management of today's complex networks, particular today's telecommunication networks. 
 The present invention contemplates an SNMP agent code generator and a RAC framework with an SAF for generation of SNMP agent code in a development environment for network management applications that resolves the above-referenced difficulties and others.

 Another object of the invention is to provide a suction head for a vacuum cleaner, which is designed for operating only when a user cleans bedclothes such as carpet and sheet, but not operating when the user cleans a hard stuff such as the floor of parlor or room. 
 Thus, the vacuum cleaner may easily suck dusts through the suction hole when cleaning the floor of parlor or room though a turbine is not rotated, while, when cleaning such bedclothes, the turbine is rotated to brush away and suck dusts adhered thereto, thereby enabling two cleaning modes with one cleaner.

" It is an object of the invention to provide a new electronically commutated motor in which direction of rotation of the rotor is detected without using a Hall sensor. 
 According to the present invention, this object is achieved by measuring or sampling at least two points of either the profile of the induced voltage, if the phase winding is within a currentless period, or the profile of the voltage drop at the transistor through which current is flowing to a currently energized phase, and processing these data to detect the rotation direction of the rotor. The result is that a value for the instantaneous rotation direction of the motor is obtained directly from the profile of the voltages induced in the motor, and the motor can be stopped and restarted if it is running the “wrong” way. 
 A particularly advantageous refinement of the invention is to make an additional, temporally separated, measurement of operating voltage, and to use this information to compensate for any noise which may have influenced the first two measurements. This allows the influence of noise voltages to be largely eliminated. This is important because a usual analog filter circuit would result in phase shifts, which would make reliable sensing of the rotation direction impossible. The temporal separation, while not ideal from a theoretical standpoint, conserves scarce computational resources. 
 Another manner of achieving the stated object is to differentiate a motor voltage signal, and to use the differentiated signal to control current flow in an associated phase winding of the stator. This makes possible simple generation of control signals in order to control the currents in the stator winding of such a motor. It has been found that it is particularly favorable, for this purpose, to differentiate the voltage induced in at least one phase, and to control the commutation of the motor using this differentiated signal. This results in very reliable commutation, even when there is a physical distance between such a motor and its electronics. This can be the case when the motor must operate in a very hot or very aggressive environment, and the motor's electronics must therefore be arranged physically separately from it.

" The present invention is a wireless fencing system that avoids some of the costs and disadvantages of the prior art. 
 A wireless fencing system in accordance with the illustrative embodiment comprises a tetherless leash, a programming fixture, and, optionally, a terminal. The tetherless leash is a portable control device that is typically attached to the collar of an animal. 
 The tetherless leash is capable of establishing a “virtual” (i.e., barrier-free) perimeter (e.g., circular, polygonal, etc.) based on geo-coordinates. The tetherless leash is also capable of monitoring the position and movement of an animal relative to the perimeter in an attempt to keep the animal on the desired side of the perimeter. The tetherless leash issues warnings, corrections, and praise, in accordance with its programming, in an attempt to control the behavior of a monitored animal. 
 A programming fixture is used in conjunction with the tetherless leash during programming operations. The fixture serves as a user interface. The programming fixture is required since, unlike the prior art, there are no exposed buttons on the tetherless leash. Although this requires the use of an additional device to program the tetherless leash, it renders the tetherless leash less susceptible to malfunction due to environmental conditions (e.g., water, etc.) than most prior-art wireless-fencing control devices. 
 Furthermore, the programming fixture covers stimulus electrodes (used to deliver a “correction” to a monitored animal) during programming operations so that a user cannot be inadvertently shocked. 
 The optional terminal is used to provide a graphical display of the perimeter to ensure that it has been properly established (e.g., correct location, etc.). Additionally, once a perimeter has been defined and stored in the tetherless leash, a copy of the programming can be downloaded to the terminal as a back-up. Also, programming information can input directly into the terminal and then downloaded to the tetherless leash. Furthermore, programming information can downloaded from a first tetherless leash to a second (e.g., spare) tetherless leash. 
","1. A method comprising: 
indirectly actuating a tetherless leash for a first period of time at a first location; 
obtaining signals when said switch is actuated for said first period of time; 
determining geo-coordinates of said tetherless leash at said first location from said signals; and 
defining a first perimeter based on said geo-coordinates of said first location."
" Briefly, the present invention provides a method and system for using various data formats and/or schemas and services to provide regularized notification handling, and provide an opportunity for user control and normalization of the operation of policies across different information types and contexts. The information-service schemas and services are combined to build a valuable, general purpose content-sensitive and context-sensitive information service that provides a notification platform. In general, via the notification platform, information services communicate information to recipient devices of users that subscribe to those services by formatting the information according to defined schemas. An information agent service collects the information, and based on various criteria, such as one of more of the content at hand, context of the user, and a user's stored preferences about notifications, determines if, when and how to send the information, and to which subscribing client device or devices. 
 The set of schemas include a notification schema that represents metadata about the subscription of a service to a source of information, as well as representing details about that information, including the nature, importance, time criticality or urgency of information, disposition over time of information provided by a message, and message handling preferences. A device schema describes metadata that represents information about one or more devices (e.g., user devices) that are enlisted or provisioned by a service. The device schema represents the data directed to various device properties, including information used by the information agent service about the connection, the rendering abilities, and interactive abilities of devices. 
 The information agent service accesses criteria including user preferences, arranged according to a schema that provides a standardized format for encoding preference information with respect to information handling and alerting. For example, the information preferences schema contains settings on subscriptions, associated preferences and tradeoffs with. A user's default routing information and explicit settings via rules, assignments, or learned preferences are stored here. 
 The user's current situation is described by metadata and formats for contextual information. To this end, presence information, location information, and schedule information describe a user's situation, or context. 
 A user-context schema comprises a standard form for representing, storing, updating, and accessing information about a user's situation, including schedule, presence, location, and time-centric profiles or other time-sensitive situation information. This includes information received from a presence schema, which comprises a regularized data format that contains attributes about the presence of a user at or near a particular device, and a location schema, which refers to a regularized form for storing data about a user's current and/or predicted location, for encoding and sharing location information among components. 
 The user-context schema also includes information received according to a schedule schema, which provides a standard representation of information about different types of appointments, and for encoding recurrent periods of time and abstractions about the location, situation, and overall informational context associated different named periods of time. A client computing context schema captures registered contextual events that characterize a user's computing activities, such as interactions with the operating system and applications and various states of the computing devices resources. A people and groups schema captures information about a user's abstractions regarding other people, with a focus on different groupings of people and their properties, for example, direct reports, or people who will be meeting with the user on a given day. An extended-context schema is defined to capture information about the nature, states, and semantics associated with new sources of contextual information that a user wishes to integrate into an information service, e.g., a user may wish to add data from a conversation detector to the user-context schema so that the platform knows when (and possibly where) the user is in, or has last been in, a conversation. 
 With the user preference data and context data, notifications directed to the user are received by the information service and routed to an appropriate user device based on the notification metadata (e.g., its importance) versus the user's preferences and context. Alternatively, the notification may be saved for later routing, or discarded, again depending on the notification data relative to the user preference data and the user's context. The device may be selected based on the preference and context data, and the notification data may be formatted to match the device properties, including its display capabilities, current network transport capabilities, and so forth.

wherein a notification service receives the notification and analyzes the third set of data against client-related criteria to determine conditions for sending the notification to the client."
" The present invention is contrived in view of such circumstances, and an object thereof is to provide an inkjet recording head, an inkjet recording apparatus and a method for manufacturing an inkjet recording head whereby cross-talk is prevented, whilst also achieving excellent productivity. 
 In order to attain the above-described object, the present invention is directed to an inkjet recording head, comprising: a plurality of ink chambers aligned, each of the plurality of ink chambers having a nozzle; and a piezoelectric element arranged on an outer side of the plurality of ink chambers, the piezoelectric element using displacement in d31 direction, piezoelectric strain absorbing holes being formed through the piezoelectric element in regions of outer perimeters of active sections of the piezoelectric element, wherein when voltage is applied to one of the active sections of the piezoelectric element, corresponding one of the plurality of ink chambers is compressed by the piezoelectric element, and ink filled in the one of the plurality of ink chambers is discharged through the nozzle toward a recording medium. 
 According to the present invention, since the piezoelectric strain absorbing holes passing through the piezoelectric element are formed in the piezoelectric element in the regions of the outer perimeters of the active sections (i.e., the discrete electrodes, the pressure chambers), then stress generated by piezoelectric strain is eliminated by means of the piezoelectric strain absorbing holes and hence cross-talk can be prevented. 
 Preferably, the inkjet recording head further comprises a vibration plate which defines the plurality of ink chambers, grooves being formed on the vibration plate at positions opposing the piezoelectric strain absorbing holes in the piezoelectric element. According to this, it is possible further to alleviate the stress generated in the vibration plate by piezoelectric strain, and hence elimination of cross-talk is promoted. 
 Preferably, the vibration plate and the piezoelectric element are bonded by means of adhesive, and the piezoelectric strain absorbing holes form escape regions for surplus adhesive during bonding. According to this, any surplus adhesive enters into the piezoelectric strain absorbing holes, thereby enabling stable bonding of the vibration plate and the piezoelectric element. Moreover, the drying time for the adhesive can also be shortened by means of the piezoelectric strain absorbing holes. 
 The present invention is also directed to an inkjet recording apparatus, comprising: a plurality of ink chambers aligned, each of the plurality of ink chambers having a nozzle; and a piezoelectric element arranged on an outer side of the plurality of ink chambers, the piezoelectric element using displacement in d31 direction, piezoelectric strain absorbing holes being formed through the piezoelectric element in regions of outer perimeters of active sections of the piezoelectric element, wherein when voltage is applied to one of the active sections of the piezoelectric element, corresponding one of the plurality of ink chambers is compressed by the piezoelectric element, and ink filled in the one of the plurality of ink chambers is discharged through the nozzle toward a recording medium. 
 The present invention is also directed to a method for manufacturing the inkjet recording head, comprising the steps of: forming a common electrode onto a first surface of a single green sheet by means of a screen printing; then forming discrete electrodes onto a second surface of the green sheet by means of screen printing; then forming the piezoelectric strain absorbing holes in the green sheet in the regions of the outer peripheries of the discrete electrodes by means of a pressing machine; then calcining the green sheet to form the piezoelectric element using displacement in d31 direction; and then bonding the piezoelectric element to a vibration plate. 
 According to the present invention, since the piezoelectric strain absorbing holes are processed after forming the common electrode and the discrete electrodes, whereupon the vibration plate is bonded, it is possible to prevent strain or damage to the vibration plate, which is liable to the vibration plate, during forming and processing, and hence productivity can be increased. 
 In the present specification, the term “recording” indicates the concept of forming images in a broad sense, including text. Furthermore, “recording medium” indicates a medium on which an image is formed by means of a recording head (this medium may be called an image forming medium, recording medium, image receiving medium, recording paper, or the like), and this term includes various types of media, irrespective of material and size, such as continuous paper, cut paper, sealed paper, resin sheets, such as OHP sheets, film, cloth, and other materials. 
 According to the present invention, cross-talk can be prevented, and productivity can be improved.

" The waterproof connector, however, is separated into a first connector component and a second connector component.

" Therefore, with the foregoing in mind, it is an object of the present invention to record a desired pit pattern by using a chemically amplified resist so as to improve the productivity, reduce a burden on an electron beam recording apparatus, and ensure the reproducibility of a pit shape. 
 It is another object of the present invention to optimize a pit shape of a transfer information surface of a transfer stamper so as to achieve the optimum shape of a transfer pit or to optimize a pit shape of a substrate so as to achieve substantially the same pit shape of each layer in a multilayer disk.

" A system for amending implementation instructions for any number or combination of Emergency Auxiliary Services, the Emergency Auxiliary Services being effected according to the implementation instructions regarding at least one predetermined receiver after a triggering communication is placed from a subscribing communication instrument includes: (a) A change ordering means for effecting the amending. The change ordering means is exercised by a service requester using the subscribing communication entity. The change ordering means is generally originated by the service requester (usually a subscriber) or on behalf of the service requester and is typically embodied in a change-ordering communication from the subscribing communication instrument. (b) An instruction amending means coupled with the subscribing communication entity. The instruction amending means responds to the change ordering means to effect the amending. The instruction amending means is generally embodied in an instruction-amending communication directed to a predetermined receiving entity that is in a position to effect the desired amendment in instructions relating to carrying out the previously ordered Emergency Auxiliary Services. 
 The apparatus of the present invention may be configured to communicate an instruction-amending communication in response to a change-ordering communication received from another entity than the service requester or the subscriber. This arrangement may be in place, by way of example and not by way of limitation, when Emergency Auxiliary Services (e.g., emergency medical assistance) is requested via an ACN (Automatic Crash Notification) device signaling a central call center that a vehicle has been involved in an accident. In this situation, the service requester may be the ACN device, the driver of the vehicle or the call center who places a call to a 9-1-1 number on behalf of the ACN service's client. An important aspect to note by this example is that the change-ordering communication does not necessarily originate from the service requester. The change-ordering communication may originate from an entity other than the service requester (e.g., the ACN call center or another entity) on behalf of the service requester. Alternatively, one may establish operating criteria or rules by which an entity other than the service requester may originate a change-ordering communication independent of the service requester to precipitate an instruction-amending communication. 
 The operating criteria may provide that a system or entity other than the system or entity that originated the request for Emergency Auxiliary Services may be employed to carry out and execute change-ordering communications and the resulting instruction-amending communication. An exemplary situation in which this arrangement may be beneficial is when a passerby lends a cellular phone to a service requester by which the service requester initiates a change-ordering communication. 
 It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a system and method for amending implementation instructions for a call notification service or other Emergency Auxiliary Services whether those services are generated automatically or upon follow-up by public safety personnel. 
 Further objects and features of the present invention will be apparent from the following specification and claims when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which like elements are labeled using like reference numerals in the various figures, illustrating the preferred embodiments of the invention.

(c) an altering means coupled with said communication entity and responding to said indication to effect said altering."
" In general, the invention is directed to techniques for performing block equalization on block-spread wireless communication signal received via one or more channels. Unlike conventional systems, e.g. direct sequence (DS)-CDMA, in which equalization is performed on a chip level basis prior to de-spreading on a per symbol basis, the techniques described herein perform block equalization to generate a block of symbol estimates subsequent to de-spreading the received signal into respective streams of de-interleaved chips for each of the channels. In particular, the received wireless communication signal is a chip-interleaved block-spread (CIBS) signal transmitted through a wireless communication channel via one or more transmitters. Moreover, the signal is received in a soft handoff environment and estimates of the information-bearing symbols are produced via a one-step block equalization process. 
 In one embodiment, a method comprises receiving a block-spread wireless communication signal via one or more channels; de-spreading the received signal to form a respective stream of de-interleaved chips for each of the one or more channels; and performing a block equalization process to generate a block of symbol estimates from the streams of de-interleaved chips. 
 In another embodiment, a wireless communication device comprising one or more antennas that receive a block-spread wireless communication signal via one or more channels; a de-spreading unit that forms a respective stream of de-interleaved chips for each of the channels; and a block equalizer that generates a block of symbol estimates from the streams of de-interleaved chips. 
 In another embodiment, the invention is directed to a computer-readable medium containing instructions. The instructions cause a programmable processor to receive via one or more channels a chip-interleaved, block-spread (CIBS) wireless communication signal formed according to interleaved chips; de-spread the received signal to form a stream of de-interleaved chips for each of the one or more channels; and perform a single-step block equalization process to generate a block of symbol estimates from the streams of de-interleaved chips. The processor performs the single-step equalization process by collecting chips from each of the streams of de-interleaved chips associated with the different channels to form a vector of chips, and processing the vector with a block equalization matrix to produce the block of symbol estimates as a vector of symbol estimates. 
 The described techniques may offer one or more advantages. For example, instead of producing symbol estimates in two steps by forming symbol estimates from the signal received for each transmitter and then combining the symbol estimates to form a final symbol estimate, as is common with conventional equalizers, one-step block equalization may be performed in which the received signals from each transmitter are collected into a vector and processed by applying a block equalization matrix to produce the block of symbol estimates as a vector of symbol estimates. Further, the one-step block equalization can produce symbol estimates regardless of the number of subchannels. Moreover, because a matrix inversion of size K is required, where K represents the number of information symbols per sub-block, there is no complexity increase relative to the conventional two-step equalization. 
 Other advantages of performing block equalization include the potential increase in the number of equivalent subchannels in CIBS-CDMA by exploiting the base station induced diversity. Furthermore, because intra-cell users are decoupled in CIBS-CDMA, increasing the power of a particular user does not affect the performance of other users and optimal power control allocation can be performed on a per user basis. Thus, inter-cell interference may be substantially reduced. Additionally, the described techniques provide flexibility in the design of the block equalizer, i.e. the described techniques can be used with both linear and non-linear equalizers as well as serial equalizers. 
 The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.

one or more antennas that receive a block-spread wireless communication signal via one or more channels;

" An object of the present invention is to compensate for reduced print pressure often found in the center of a blanket cylinder while still avoiding inward wrinkling. 
 The present invention provides a printing blanket comprising: 



 a carrier sleeve layer having at least one axially convex surface when disposed on a blanket cylinder; and 
 a print layer disposed over the carrier sleeve layer. 




 By having an inner convex carrier sleeve layer with a convex surface, the print pressure at the axial center of the blanket cylinder can be increased. 
 The convexity of the carrier sleeve layer may be provided, for example, by having the carrier sleeve layer have a uniform inner diameter and a convex outer diameter. The carrier sleeve layer itself is thus thicker in an axial middle than at the ends. 
 Alternately, the carrier sleeve can be of uniform thickness, and the blanket cylinder or a shim may provide the surface convexity. 
 The print layer may have a uniform thickness or a varying thickness. Most preferably, the outer surface of the print layer has a convex axial profile when the blanket is disposed on the blanket cylinder, although this is not necessary. 
 The blanket when disposed on the blanket cylinder thus preferably provides uniform axial print or nip pressure across the width of the blanket.

" The inventors of the present invention have succeeded to prepare a film having high polarization anisotropy by forming a mesostructured silica film having highly uniaxially oriented mesopores by a simple method, and introducing light-emitting conjugated polymer molecules into the mesopores to strictly control the orientation of the polymer chains. 
 Thus, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a polarized light-emitting film comprising a porous silica film formed on a substrate and a conjugated polymer held in a plurality of uniaxially oriented, tubular mesopores in the porous silica film, wherein fluorescence emitted from the film is polarized in a direction parallel to the orientation direction of the mesopores.

Preferably, the polymer film has a structural anisotropy in a plane.

 According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for producing a polarized light-emitting film comprising the steps of: 



 forming on a substrate a mesostructured silica film containing a plurality of tubular molecular assemblies of molecules of a surfactant aligned in one direction;

 reacting the surfaces of the hollow mesopores with a silane coupling agent; and

" The present invention includes monolithically integrated D-mode/E-mode FET devices, and methods of making such devices. 
 In one embodiment, a monolithically integrated D-mode/E-mode FET device includes a D-mode transistor and an E-mode transistor in a substrate. The substrate includes a plurality of semiconductor layers, including a channel layer overlaid by a barrier layer that is overlaid by an etch stop layer that is overlaid by an ohmic contact layer. Source and drain contacts of the D-mode and E-mode transistors are coupled to the ohmic contact layer. Gate contacts of the D-mode and E-mode transistors are coupled to an upper surface of the barrier layer. Beneath the E-mode gate contact and within the barrier layer is an amorphized region that includes at least one layer of an electrically conductive compound formed by a diffusion of a metal layer into the semiconductor of the barrier layer. The amorphized region forms a Schottky contact with underlying semiconductor portions of the barrier layer. 
 Accordingly, the monolithically integrated D-mode/E-mode FET device of this example that includes a single barrier layer, to which both the D-mode and E-mode gate contacts are coupled, and a single etch stop layer. The structure of the multi-layer substrate therefore is simplified, rendering the making of the transistors easier and less expensive. Moreover, the performance of the D-mode and E-mode transistors is improved. The D-mode transistor is more reliable and repeatable that in the conventional device, because the E-mode specific etch stop layer and barrier layer that were under the D-mode gate contact and D-mode barrier layer of the conventional device are eliminated. The E-mode transistor performance is improved because the Schottky contact between the E-mode gate contact and the semiconductor material of the barrier layer is buried beneath the upper surface of the barrier layer. This significantly reduces the risks posed by dangling bonds, defects, and surface states in the ungated region and gate recess sidewalls. 
 In an alternative embodiment, the D-mode transistor's gate contact is not coupled to the same barrier layer to which the E-mode gate contact is coupled, but rather is coupled to an overlying semiconductor layer. The D-mode contact is, like the E-mode gate contact, formed in a manner that allows an initial metal layer of the D-mode gate contact to diffuse into the semiconductor layer, thereby forming a D-mode amorphization region that provides a Schottky contact with underlying portions of the semiconductor layer. This embodiment also improves on the conventional structure provided above, because it reduces the risks posed by dangling bonds, defects, and surface states in the ungated region and gate recess sidewalls. 
 These and other aspects of the present invention may be better understood by reference to the following detailed description of the exemplary embodiments, when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings thereof.

" In a device according to the present invention trenches are formed to have a serpentine appearance. That is, unlike a stripe trench which advances along a single direction, a trench in a device according to the present invention changes direction, thereby creating a serpentine pattern. 
 Thus, for example, a trench may extend for a part thereof from a northwest position to a southeast position and then, in the next segment thereof, change direction and extend from a northeast position to a southwest position for another part thereof. 
 In an alternative serpentine pattern, a trench may change direction at a ninety degree angle to its common direction of advancement, extend from a west position to an east position for a part thereof, change direction to extend parallel to its common direction of advancement, and then change direction at a ninety degree angle to its common direction of advancement, and extend from an east position to a west position for another part thereof. 
 In yet another alternative serpentine pattern, a trench may change direction along a generally sinusoidal path. 
 According to one aspect of the present invention immediately adjacent trenches alternate in direction opposite to one another, thus forming a mirror image of one another. Such an arrangement allows the trenches to be brought closer to one another in some regions while spaced relatively farther apart in other regions. As a result, the trenches may be packed more densely in at least a portion of the device, thereby increasing the overall density of the active cells. 
 Additionally, the trenches may be spaced apart wide enough in some regions to allow enough room for the source contact. 
 The preferred embodiment of the present invention may be a power MOSFET, although other power semiconductor device such as IGBTs may equally benefit from the present invention. 
 Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the invention which refers to the accompanying drawings.

" The present invention is directed to a system and method for determining the orientation of an object based on its positioning relative to a source of electromagnetic energy, for example, the sun. In this manner, the present invention provides an accurate, reliable, and economical approach for determining object orientation, without being subject to the limitations associated with the conventional electronic and magnetic compasses. 
 In one aspect, the present invention is directed to a system for determining the orientation of an object relative to a source of electromagnetic radiation. The system includes a plurality of sensors, each of the sensors producing a corresponding output signal when placed in the path of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a source. A controller receives the output signals of the sensors, and for determining the orientation of the object relative to the source based on the sensor output signals. 
 The source of the electromagnetic radiation may comprise, for example, a heavenly body, for example, the sun. The electromagnetic radiation is for example, of a type selected from the group consisting of visible radiation, infrared radiation, and ultraviolet radiation. 
 In one example, the sensors are optical sensors, for example photodiodes. The output signals are derived from the intensity of light radiation received at the photodiodes. Each of the sensors has a corresponding viewing angle having a center line, and the center lines are at known orientations relative to each other. The center lines may, for example, lie on a plane and/or may intersect at a common point. 
 In another example, the controller samples multiple sets of the sensor output signals at periodic time intervals. In this case, the controller's determination of the orientation of the object is based on multiple sets of the sensor output signals. The controller further determines a subset of the output signals of the sensors, for example at least three sensor output signals, having signal levels that are greater than those of the other output signals, and fits a polynomial to the output signals of the subset. The controller then determines one of a maximum and minimum of the polynomial, and determines the orientation of the object based on the one of the maximum and minimum. 
 The controller optionally determines the orientation of the object further based on a known factor of the type consisting of: time, latitude, longitude, and altitude. 
 The controller determines the orientation of the object further based on a theoretical determination of the electromagnetic radiation source position. The controller further determines the orientation of the object by comparing the theoretical determination of the electromagnetic radiation source position to an actual determination of the position based on the sensor output signals. 
 In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a system for determining the orientation of an object relative to a source of electromagnetic radiation. The system includes a two-dimensional array of sensors, each of the sensors in the array producing a corresponding output signal when placed in the path of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a source. A lens directs the electromagnetic radiation from the source onto the two-dimensional array. A controller receives the output signals of the sensors, and determines the orientation of the object relative to the source based on the sensor output signals. 
 The two-dimensional array of sensors comprises, for example, a charge-coupled device (CCD) array, or a bolometer array. 
 The output signals of the sensors may comprise binary signals that indicate those sensor elements of the two-dimensional sensor array that are activated in response to receiving the electromagnetic energy at a level above a predetermined threshold. The controller determines the orientation of the object based on multiple samples of the sensor output signals taken at predetermined time intervals. The controller further tracks elements of the sensor array that are activated at each sample interval, and fits a polynomial to the activated sensor elements over time. The orientation of the object is then determined based on the polynomial. 
 The lens may comprise, for example, a pinhole in a housing body containing the two-dimensional array of sensors. 
 In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a method for determining the orientation of an object relative to a source of electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation emitted by a source is received at a plurality of sensors. Each of the sensors produces a corresponding output signal in response to the received electromagnetic radiation. An actual position of the source of electromagnetic energy is determined based on the sensor output signals.

" It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved breakaway system for a boom. It is a further object to provide such a breakaway system which overcomes most or all of the aforementioned problems. 
 It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an improved boom breakaway system which can absorb sufficient impact force to limit overall boom loading to non-destructive levels while at the same time preventing excess boom momentum and oscillation. 
 It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved breakaway system for a boom which is particularly useful for use with the large multi-section booms. It is yet another object to provide such a system which provides inner boom section pivoting relative to a center frame. It is a further object to provide such a system which provides a relatively large and controlled boom travel to clear an obstacle. 
 It is a further object to provide an improved hydraulically operated boom breakaway system. It is another object to provide such a system having a staged pressure buildup during breakaway which effectively absorbs impact energy hydraulically before a breakaway cylinder reaches full stroke. It is a further object to provide such a system which operates smoothly and effectively limits impact loads through the boom to reduce or eliminate structural damage during an impact. 
 Boom inner wings are attached to a boom center frame at hinge joints which normally allow the wings to fold 90 degrees from a forward transport position to an extended spraying position under the control of a hydraulic folding cylinder. In the present design, the fold cylinder, which in many previous designs extended between the center frame and inner wing, is attached to a rocker that is pivotally connected to the center frame. The rocker is attached to a breakaway hydraulic cylinder normally pressurized towards a full stroke position and connected to an accumulator. When a wing impacts an object, the impact load is transmitted through the fold cylinder, rocker and into the breakaway cylinder. If the load is large enough, the cylinder will begin to retract, and pressure in the system increases and follows a pressure curve dependent on the accumulator. As the breakaway cylinder retracts to allow the wing to pivot, pressure builds in the system in three stages. First pressure builds along an accumulator pressure curve until a relief valve in the hydraulic system activates to initiate the second stage wherein oil is dumped through the relief valve. Thereafter, pressure is again allowed to build along the same accumulator curve. This staged pressure build effectively absorbs the energy imported into the boom from impact hydraulically before the cylinder reaches full stroke. The staged pressure build also prevents boom momentum from gaining and loads from increasing above the strength of the overall structure. 
 The system is completely hydraulic and eliminates need for mechanical wear surfaces or adjustments. The hydraulic valve controls the deceleration of the breakaway cylinder at the end of stroke. Compared to systems having a cylinder with built-in cushioning orifices, the resulting system is less expensive and complex than at least most other commercially available hydraulic breakaway systems and facilitates a smooth spring-like absorption of the energy of a moving boom as the breakaway cylinder resistance force increases with retraction of the breakaway cylinder. The accumulator additionally provides a cushion effect for the entire boom under normal field operation. 
 These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description below when taken with the drawings.
","1. A boom assembly including a boom support frame, a boom section pivotally connected to the boom support frame for movement between a working position and a breakaway position, a hydraulic breakaway cylinder having a first condition for maintaining the boom section in the working position and a breakaway condition permitting movement of the boom section towards the breakaway position when the boom section encounters an obstacle, hydraulic valve structure connected to the breakaway cylinder, an accumulator connected to the breakaway cylinder, wherein the hydraulic valve structure and the accumulator provide staged pressure control of breakaway cylinder operating pressure to absorb energy as the boom section moves from the working position, the staged pressure increasing as the boom section approaches the breakaway position to limit momentum of the boom section."
" The present invention relates to a novel drill-tap device and method for localizing, starting, drilling, and tapping the intended site of bone screw insertion in a single operation, using a single tool. By radiographic visualization, or other technique, the distal end of the drill-tap device is placed in the proper starting location on the surface of the bone, either by penetration of the skin for cutaneous procedures or by dissection to the surface of the bone for open procedures. The shaft of the drill-tap device is aligned in proper orientation. A tool, such as a hammer, is used to impact the proximal end of the drill-tap device, thereby driving the distal cutting tip of the drill-tap into the bone and creating a small bore in the bone at the desired location. The drill-tap device can be rotated by hand or with an instrument, such as a drill. By rotating the drill-tap device, the bore is enlarged and sized to the root diameter of the intended bone screw. As the drill-tap device progresses into the bone, the device cuts threads into the surface of the bore to facilitate bone screw insertion. The drill-tap is then removed and a bone screw is placed in the bore formed by the drill-tap device. Speed and reduced instrumentation are substantial advantages of this device. Also, by drilling and enlarging the bore with a single device, correction of alignment may be achieved before the final bore is made. 
 Further, the device tends to direct itself toward the intended hole orientation. In the placement of pedicle screws, the pedicle is targeted. After penetration, the slope of the advancing drill tip enlarges the bore and the sides of the drill tip begin to contact the inner wall of the pedicle. Since the density is greater at the cortical bone of the wall, the device tends to penetrate the softer cancellous bone of the pedicle. Similarly, when installing stabilization screws into intermedullary devices, such as a femoral rod, the smaller tip of the drill-tap device finds the hole of the rod after cortical penetration. As the drill-tip device progresses further, the path of least resistance is through the hole of the rod and the enlarging drill tip point centers itself within this hole. 
 Furthermore, image guiding technology that aids in the placement of bone screws with minimal use of x-rays can also be utilized. The drill-tap device can either be used independently or with the assistance of image guiding technology, such as ultrasound, video, electromagentic waves, or infrared light. 
 The present invention can also be used to increase the effectiveness of a surgical retractor. A bone screw hole is drilled into the bone at a point where a retractor would be of optimum benefit. The head of the screw, formed to accept the retractor, is inserted into the hole. By anchoring the retractor against the fixed point of screw placement, the retractor is less likely to slip than on an irregular bony surface. After the surgical procedure, the screw can be removed. 
 Additionally, if desired, a screw of smaller diameter can be placed into a pedicle for visualization during spinal surgery. When it is no longer needed, the screw can be removed and, after proper preparation, this bore can be filled with a pedicle screw. 
","1. A device for drilling and tapping a bore comprising: 
a) a drill tip portion having at least one cutting edge; 
b) a threaded shank portion having distal and proximal portions at opposite ends thereof, extending longitudinally from said drill tip portion beginning at the proximal portion of said threaded shank portion; and 
c) a shaft portion extending longitudinally from said threaded shank portion."
" Accordingly, a primary object of the present invention is to provide a locking device that includes an annular locking sleeve arranged concentrically about the smooth outer circumferential surface of the steering shaft, which sleeve has a serpentine cross-sectional configuration, thereby to define successive smooth convex projections and concave valleys on the inner and outer peripheries of the sleeve. The sleeve is normally non-rotatably connected with the steering shaft owing to the provision of a predetermined frictional force between the inner convex projections on the sleeve and the circumferential surface of the steering shaft. When the locking sleeve is prevented from rotation by the insertion of a stationary locking arm into a locking slot on the outer periphery of the sleeve, upon overload the predetermined frictional force is overcome, thereby permitting the steering shaft to rotate relative to the sleeve, so that deformation and/or destruction of the components is avoided. 
 According to a more specific object of the present invention, the rotational torque limiting locking device of a steering column on an automotive vehicle comprises a steering shaft on which is concentrically arranged a sleeve that cooperates with the bolt of a locking device constituting an antitheft device for said vehicle and whose inside face cooperates with said steering shaft in order to bring about the torque limiting force. The sleeve consists of a tubular body portion having a serpentine cross-sectional configuration with a generally constant thickness throughout, thereby to define successive convex projections and concave valleys on the inner and outer peripheries of the sleeve. Radially extending teeth are arranged on the exterior convex projections at an equal distance from each other so as to define between pairs of contiguous teeth a radial slot adapted to receive the locking arm, thereby to lock the steering column in a desired angular position. 
 The sleeve is fixed on the steering shaft by means of a predetermined frictional force developed between the protruding convex portions on the interior surface of the locking sleeve and the outer circumferential surface of the steering shaft, said frictional force being greater than the maximum torque applied to the steering shaft during routine driving conditions. 
 The transverse angular position of the teeth is independent of the transverse angular position of the radial interior convex projections, thereby to permit one to precisely adapt a number of interior convex shapes to the maximum torque to be transmitted, and so as to be able exactly to adapt the number and the transverse shape of the radial teeth to the automotive vehicle concerned. 
 According to one particularly interesting embodiment of the invention, the pitch of the teeth are twice the pitch of the radial interior convex projections. 
 To provide a better frictional connection of the sleeve in response to the various stresses, the two side walls of each radial locking slot are generally parallel. Moreover, each of the two faces of each radial slot is connected with the corresponding exterior surface of the sleeve body portion by a rounded face. 
 According to one embodiment of the invention, the sleeve is provided with radial slots that extend axially the length of the sleeve. In another embodiment, the sleeve of the locking device is provided with radial slots that extend axially from one end of the sleeve only partly the length of he sleeve, thereby to define an annular flange portion at the other end of the sleeve.

 The term the “rigid resin material” as used herein and in the appended claims refers to either a thermoplastic material or a thermosetting material, but does not include a soft resin material. States more specifically, the term the “rigid resin material” means a resin material which is at least 6.895×107 Pa in modulus of elasticity. 
 The tip main body is covered over the outer peripheral surface thereof with a slide sleeve of rigid resin.

" One aspect of the present invention is the provision of improvements to a bearing or drive assembly of the type described above. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a bearing or drive assembly includes at least two bearing elements or drive elements that are adapted for movement relative to each other, with at least one of the bearing elements or drive elements including a polyimide coating on a carrier material. 
 The fact that at least one bearing or drive element comprises a polyimide coating on a carrier material permits reducing the lubricant needs and thus the operating costs to a great extent in comparison with lubricated bearing elements of steel. Preferably, a supply of lubricant is no longer required during operation, and production costs are considerably reduced in comparison with ceramic bearing elements, carbide-coated bearing elements, and bearing elements of a solid material of plastic. Since bearing elements of solid plastic material exhibit a very high absorption of water, which may lead to a brittleness of the material, the bearing assembly of the present invention has the additional advantage that the bearing and drive elements with a polyimide coating absorb negligibly little water, i.e., they are hydrolytically stable. Furthermore, the polyimide coating of the present invention facilitates a longer service life of the bearing or drive assembly. 
 It is possible to utilize the bearing or drive assembly of the present invention in a large variety of technical fields, such as motive power engineering or automobile manufacturing, and in all dimensional ranges, i.e., both in the case of very small dimensions, such as for fine and finest mechanics, and in the case of very large dimensions, such as for windmills. In the case of antifriction bearings, the rings and/or rolling bodies may be coated. The bearing or drive assembly of the invention may also be in the form of a gearing, for example, a toothed gearing, a plain bearing, a linear guideway, for example, with rails adapted for relative movement toward one another, or as a chain drive. 
 A very thin formation of the polyimide coating is simpler and more cost-favorable to produce, and increases the advantages of hydrolytic stability and longer service life. As protection against corrosion of the carrier material that normally consists for the most part of iron, a passivation coating is applied to the carrier material below the polyimide coating, i.e., chronologically before applying the latter. To the extent that high pressure loads are to be expected in the bearing assembly, a pressure-resistant coating may be additionally applied to the passivated carrier material below and/or inside the polyimide coating. 
 Preferably, the polyimide coating is prepared from a dissolved prepolymer (prepolymer solution), which is directly obtained from the raw materials or by reversing the polymerization. In a next step, it is preferred to immerse the bearing or drive element into this prepolyimide, so that a thin polyimide film forms. While it is not necessary to add special lubricants in this process, such an addition is possible as an option.
","1. A bearing or drive assembly, comprising: 
at least two elements that are adapted for movement relative to each other, wherein: 
the at least two elements are selected from the group consisting of bearing elements and drive elements, and 
at least one element of the at least two elements includes a carrier material and a polyimide coating on the carrier material."

 The film forming apparatus according to the present invention is a film forming apparatus for forming a film on the surfaces of substrates while transferring substrate holders holding the substrates along a path in vacuum chambers including: a substrate holder stock chamber being connected so as to be capable of communicating with and of kept sealed hermetically with vacuum in film forming chambers in the film forming apparatus via a gate valve, wherein the substrate holders are retrieved and fed by a retrieving mechanism for retrieving the substrate holders from the path and a feeding mechanism for feeding the substrate holders to the path without exposing the substrate holders in atmospheric air.

 The substrate holder stock chamber of the film forming apparatus according to the invention includes a film removing mechanism for removing a film accumulated on the surfaces of the substrate holders. 
 Retrieving and feeding of the substrate holders in the film forming apparatus according to the invention are performed by separate substrate holder stock chambers respectively. 
 The substrate holder stock chambers of the film forming apparatus according to the invention include a mechanism or mechanisms having a slide carrier capable of arranging the surfaces of the plurality of substrate holders in parallel and of moving linearly and vertically for feeding the substrate holders to, and/or retrieving the substrate holders from, the path in the film forming apparatus. 
 The substrate holder stock chambers of the film forming apparatus according to the invention include a mechanism arranging the plurality of substrate holders around a center axis of a rotating mechanism for feeding the substrate holders to, and/or retrieving the substrate holders from, the path in the film forming apparatus by means of the rotating mechanism. 
 The substrate holder stock chamber of the film forming apparatus according to the invention has a structure capable of being connected to a direction-changing chamber, which is a chamber for changing the direction of the substrate holders. 
 According to the invention, since the substrate holder stock chamber for storing the plurality of substrate holders is provided in the path in the film forming apparatus, so that the substrate holders are retrieved from the path and fed to the path while vacuum is retained, production can be performed without being affected by the process of replacing the substrate holder and the process of removing the film from the surface of the substrate holder, or by the process of replacing the substrate holder or the process of removing the film on the surface of the substrate holder. Therefore, time required for replacing the used substrate holder with the new ones is reduced, and efficient production is achieved. 
 Since the substrate holder stock chamber of the film forming apparatus according to the invention is provided with a degasificating mechanism, degasification can be performed without taking out the substrate holder into atmospheric air. 
 Since the substrate holder stock chamber of the film forming apparatus according to the invention can remove the accumulated film from the substrate holders in a separate route, generation of particles can be prevented without affecting the film forming process. 
 Since the substrate holder stock chamber of the film forming apparatus according to the invention includes an accumulated film removing mechanism and the accumulated film on the surface of the substrate holders can be removed without exposing the substrate holders in atmospheric air, re-evacuation of air from atmospheric air is not necessary, thereby improving the productivity. 
 The substrate holder stock chamber of the film forming apparatus according to the invention can be connected not only to the direction-changing chamber in the path, but also to the vacuum chamber, a load lock chamber, and an unload lock chamber. In particular, if the structure is such that a stock chamber for feeding substrate holders and a stock chamber for retrieving substrate holders are connected respectively to the two direction-changing chambers located close to each other for performing retrieving and feeding of the substrate holders independently, the productivity can further be improved.

" The present invention overcomes the deficiencies of the prior art by providing a telescopic shore in which fine adjustment can be accomplished by turning one tube while the other remains stationary. The tube that is rotated can be grasped at a location between a worker's shoulders and knees. 
 The invention employs two mutually telescopic tubes in the same fashion conventional shores do. The larger of the two tubes (outer tube) is usually positioned above the smaller one (inner tube). The outer tube includes a rotating collar at one end in which a hole for a pin is located. 
 The vertical load in the outer tube is transferred to the inner tube via a pin that engages the inner tube. The use of a rotating collar on the outer tube ensures that the smaller inner tube can be rotated without rotating the outer tube. It may be desirable in some instances to reverse the orientation of the tubes with the smaller tube above the large tube and arranged in a similar fashion to the foregoing such that the larger lower tube can be rotated without rotating the upper smaller tube. 
 Coarse adjustment, typically within 3 inches, or approximately 7.5 cm, of the desired length, is provided by inserting a pin in a series of equally spaced holes provided in the smaller inner tube as is typically found with conventional shores. 
 Rotating the lower tube (inner or outer tube) provides fine adjustment. This lower tube has either a nut or a threaded cylinder attached to its lowest end that cooperates with a corresponding threaded cylinder or nut attached to the base plate of the shore. 
 The nut/threaded cylinder assembly providing fine adjustment can be made with a significantly smaller screw pitch diameter than the screw pitch diameter used on a conventional type 1 shore. As indicated above, in a type 1 shore the screw diameter is larger than the diameter of the larger outer tube. As the torque required to strip the shore varies directly with the screw pitch diameter, the present invention offers the advantage of significantly reduced stripping torques. 
 Further, the user does not need to reach to the bottom of the shore to make a fine adjustment. A single person can easily steady the shore with one hand while turning the inner or outer tube as the case may be with the other hand to make fine adjustments or strip the shore. 
 The present invention therefore provides a shoring post comprising: i) an outer tube; ii) an inner tube slidably received within said outer tube, at least one of said inner tube and said outer tube being rotatable relative to the other; iii) coarse adjustment means for limiting travel of said inner tube into said outer tube, said coarse adjustment means having: a rotatable collar located at one end of said outer tube; and an affixing means for affixing said collar to said inner tube; and iv) fine adjustment means at one end of said post, comprising a threaded cylinder and a threaded receiver, wherein a selected one of said threaded cylinder and threaded receiver is integral with a selected one of said outer or inner tubes, whereby rotation of said selected one of said outer or inner tubes effects said fine adjustment.

" It is therefore an object of this invention to capture both the control flow as well as memory references of a program during execution. 
 It is therefore another object of this invention to facilitate the association of generalized events with each point in the control flow. 
 It is therefore another object of this invention to associate values with an event occurring during execution of a program. 
 It is therefore another object of this invention to provide an efficient compression mechanism for a program trace. 
 It is therefore another object of this invention to facilitate the composition of a trace of a program as a collection of segments of desired size, so that each segment of the trace can be accessed and processed independently. 
 Accordingly, this invention employs a compact representation of the execution trace of a program on a machine for tracing and executing the program. 
 More specifically, with this invention, values associated with each event are compressed separately, thereby providing improved compression. 
 More specifically, with this invention control flow is captured as a compressed sequence of values with branch events. 
 More specifically, one aspect of this invention is a method of generating a trace of a program. This method starts with defining a sequence of events for the program. The sequence of values is then determined for each of the defined events during an execution of the program, and each sequence of values is then compressed to generate a compressed sequence of values for each event. These values are then ordered in accordance with information stored in selected events (such as for example, branch events), where the ordered values correspond to the trace. 
 Often, when an event generates a regular pattern of values, it presents an opportunity for optimization of the corresponding event. Data prefetching and branch prediction are popular examples of this phenomenon. The representation of the trace greatly influences how easily such patterns can be detected and how architectures can react to them. Our proposed compression and representation renders several such opportunities as described below. 
 With this invention complete execution information is captured and can be used for simulation experiments for studying architectural and program variations. 
 With this invention values for repeatedly executed events are captured in a very compact form. This compressed form of event-values acts as a signature for the behavior of the event and can be used for analysis and optimization.
","1. A method of creating a compressed trace for a program, said method comprising: 
selecting a sequence of events for said program; 
obtaining a sequence of values for each of said events, which values were obtained by executing said program; 
compressing each said sequence of values to generate a compressed sequence of values for each event, wherein the collection of compressed sequences of values of events generates a compressed trace; and 
ordering said values of said compressed trace to generate an uncompressed trace of said program."

" In the conventional overvoltage suppression means, when an overvoltage is detected, the output terminal of the generator is connected to GND (the ground terminal) of the power source and is discharged. During the normal operation, in addition to the switching element for converting the power, an additional switching element is used, so that circuit elements are increased and the structure is complicated. In place of the additional switching element, a controller may be used. However, when an overvoltage is generated in a state that there is no power source for the controller, the overvoltage suppression means does not operate. 
 Further, in the conventional overvoltage suppression means, the operation of the switching element of the power conversion circuit when the motor or generator is operated normally and the operation of the switching element of the power conversion circuit when an overvoltage is generated are different from each other. Therefore, when an overvoltage is generated, the switching element of the power conversion circuit performs a wrong ON operation and an internal short circuit may be generated. 
 The voltage detector used for the overvoltage suppression means requires accuracy and noise resistance. The reason is that the switching element of the power converter requires not only the withstand voltage to the supply voltage but also the withstand voltage to an error of the voltage detector. For example, assuming the supply voltage as 60 V and the accuracy of the voltage detector as 20 V, the switching element requires a withstand voltage of 80 V or more. 
 However, a high withstand voltage of the switching element causes an increase in loss of the switching element and an increase in cost. Therefore, the voltage detector requires high accuracy and noise resistance. 
 An object of the present invention is to perform protection for an overvoltage of a switching element in a power converter accurately and correctly. 
 Another object of the present invention is to rationalize the withstand voltage of the switching element of the power converter, thereby realize high efficiency and cut-down of cost. 
 According to the present invention, the power converter has a power conversion circuit, when driving a motor, for converting power from a battery and supplying it to the motor and when the motor generates power, converting the generated power of the motor and supplying it to the battery for storage of electricity and a drive circuit for driving the power conversion circuit. 
 The power conversion circuit includes a plurality of paired switching elements, in which one of each paired switching elements is arranged on an upper arm, and the other is arranged on a lower arm, and each pair corresponds to each phase of the motor. 
 The drive circuit, when the voltage applied to the power conversion circuit is increased, turns on all the switching elements on one arm, turns off all the switching elements on the other arm, thereby short-circuits the output terminals of the motor. 
 According to the present invention, high reliability, high efficiency, and cut-down of cost of the power converter can be realized. According to the present invention, for overvoltage suppression of the power converter, high reliability can be obtained.

" The present invention discloses methods for improving the computational efficiency and overall capabilities of RSA and related public key cryptographic systems. In prior art, decryption of messages that are encrypted using a public key {e, N} is always achieved using all of the distinct prime factors of N. For example, the private exponent d is usually calculated such that e*d=1 mod Z, where Z is the product of each of the prime factors of N minus 1. In addition, RSA implementations that employ the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) also use each of the distinct prime factors of N as moduli in small modular exponentiations that are combined to perform decryption.

" The present invention seeks to at least reduce the problems mentioned above. Furthermore, it has for its object to provide a nonwoven fabric useful as a primary carpet backing, which is easily and inexpensively manufactured, shows a good long term stability and easy molding behavior. 
 Surprisingly, the object of the invention can be achieved by a nonwoven fabric as described in the opening paragraph, wherein the polymeric sheath component is selected from the group containing polypropylene and copolymers comprising polypropylene and/or blends thereof. Especially preferred is homo-polypropylene. 
 In comparison to the nonwoven fabrics useful for primary carpet backings of the prior art, the nonwoven fabric according to the invention exhibits an improved homogeneity due to the fact that there are no binding fibers necessary and at the same time has an abundance of bonding points, which renders the fabric strong and resistant against mechanical demands.

" Briefly described, the preferred embodiment of this invention describes a device to prevent a child from rolling away while its diaper is being changed. The device is used in conjunction with a stiff changing pad or table. The device has an attachment mechanism that fastens around the changing pad to hold it securely to the pad. The device has two shoulder straps and two chest straps that fasten around the child's chest and over the shoulders. The device is positioned underneath the child so that the four straps come from underneath, come over and around the child, and fasten together in the front using a fastening mechanism such as hook and loop, or buckles. This design holds the child's shoulders securely down to the pad so that the child is not able to initiate a rolling movement. An important factor which is not obvious to people without training in positioning and maintaining positions, and which differentiates this device from other devices is that the straps of this device are initiated from behind the child and then come up and over the shoulders and up and over the chest. Other devices come from directly on the sides or top of the changing pad, and therefore do not have full contact with the child, whereas this device has full contact and gives a strong pull to the shoulders down in to the changing pad. Another option of this device is for it to be sewn directly to the changing pad cover rather than strapped around it. Yet another option of this device is to have it directly attached to the pad and have the chest and shoulder straps out of the middle of the changing pad. 
 In use, the device is first fastened to the changing pad using the attachment mechanism by buckling it securely and snugly on to the changing pad. With the device open, the child is then placed on top of the device, with arms above the chest straps, and head in between the shoulder straps. The chest straps are then placed across the child's chest and fastened with hook and loop. The shoulder straps are then brought up and over the shoulders and fastened on to the chest straps using hook and loop. The diaper is then changed in the typical fashion with the child securely held in place by the device, unable to roll, wiggle, or squirm away. The device can remain on the changing pad, is adjustable for use with multiple children of different sizes, and cam be easily transported and strapped to public changing stations in restrooms. The device is made out of a soft, washable, cotton material for comfort.

" A design process for implementing coherent categorization includes defining a categorization scheme, linking the categories to stored information, and providing at least two executable response modules for performing business processes using a single categorization. The design process can be used in the design-time environment to develop coherently categorized run-time modules. Although coherently categorized run-time modules perform different steps in a business process, they use stored information linked to the same category. As such, coherently categorized run-time modules perform steps in a business process using a single categorization step. This provides various performance and integration advantages to an enterprise, thereby reducing costs and improving efficiency. 
 In one aspect, a method of defining a system for responding to an incoming electronic message (IEM) includes defining a categorization scheme having a plurality of hierarchically organized categories. The method also includes linking stored information to each defined category. In addition, the method includes providing multiple response procedure modules. Each response procedure module, when executed under user control, uses the stored information that is linked to a selected one of the defined categories. The selected category is determined by analyzing the content of the IEM. 
 The foregoing aspect may be modified. For example, the stored information may include business objects. Such business objects may be any of quick solutions, experts, or response templates. Furthermore, the defined system may perform a business process, which in some cases may be an ERMS. The system may also be a contact center, or an interaction center. 
 In other examples, at least one of the multiple response procedures may perform a step of responding to an IEM. The IEM may be an email, or it may be received via Internet self-service. The categorization scheme may be hierarchical and have at least two levels of categories. 
 Other examples involve defining queries for each category. These defined queries may be evaluated to analyze the content of the IEM to select categories for which the corresponding defined queries match the content of the IEM. 
 In another aspect, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, cause a processor to perform operations to define a system for responding to an IEM in accord with the method aspect described above. 
 The computer program product aspect may be modified such that at least one of the response procedure modules, when executed, performs a step in an ERMS business process, performs a step other than a step in an ERMS business process, or performs a step in an interaction center. 
 In still another aspect, a computer-implemented system for defining a system for responding to an IEM includes a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI is capable of defining categorization schemes to have a plurality of hierarchically organized categories, and capable of linking stored information to each category. The system also includes multiple response procedure modules. Each response procedure module, when executed under user control, uses the stored information that is linked to a selected one of the defined categories. The selected category is determined by analyzing the content of the IEM. 
 The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. These aspects and implementations may provide various advantages. For example, implementations provide enterprise system end users a method by which to develop and to maintain run-time modules that reap the benefits of coherent categorization. The benefits of coherent categorization include, for example, improved auto-suggestion of responses to incoming requests for information. Accordingly, the methods reduce the enterprise's reliance on software vendors and consultants by enabling the enterprise to employ self-help to create and maintain customized business software, especially business software that involves coherent categorization. Other features, objects, and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.

" It is an aim of the present invention to provide an improved method and a system for positioning, as well as a device in which the method is applied. In the invention, instead of iterative computation, closed computation is utilized to find the position solution. In the solution, instead of overdetermination, a minimum number of measurement results or, in practice, the measurement of three different signals is used to find a three-dimensional position solution. The invention is based on the idea that the measurements to be taken are used to determine geometric surfaces whose points of intersection are determined by computation. One of such points of intersection is closest to the real position, wherein the coordinate data of this point of intersection can be used as the position solution. Geometric surfaces are, at the most, quadratic surfaces (quadrics). Furthermore, the aim is that as few of the determined surfaces as possible are quadratic surfaces, preferably only one, the other surfaces being planes. To put it more precisely, the method according to the present invention is primarily characterized in that in the method, on the basis of measurements, a geometric model is selected which comprises, at the most, quadratic surfaces, the selected geometric model is simplified to reduce the number of quadratic surfaces, the measurement results are inserted in a simplified geometric model, and the position of the device is determined by solving the simplified geometric model. The system according to the present invention is primarily characterized in that the system comprises means for selecting, on the basis of measurements, a geometric model comprising, at the most, quadratic surfaces, means for simplifying the selected geometric model to reduce the number of quadratic surfaces, means for inserting measurement results in the simplified geometric model, and means for solving the simplified geometric model to determine the position of a device.

Thus, the device may require less computing capacity. When applying the method according to the invention, it is possible to achieve all the possible position solutions, from which the correct one can be determined by a suitable criterion. However, the iterative method only gives one position solution which may, however, not be correct. Furthermore, the positioning is faster, which also reduces the power consumption of the device. The positioning also works better under poor signal conditions compared with systems based on satellites only. The method according to the invention can also be used in a situation in which the number of measurements available is not sufficient for methods applying overdetermination.

" In accordance with an aspect of the invention, a side-emitting laser is enclosed in a cavity formed between two wafers or substrates. One or more of the substrates can include passive or active electrical circuits that are connected to the laser. An optical element such as a turning mirror can also be integrated into a substrate, e.g. into a wall of the cavity formed in the substrate. 
 A wafer-level packaging process in accordance with an embodiment of the invention includes forming multiple cavities and turning mirrors on a first wafer and forming electrical device connections and/or active components on a second wafer. Optoelectronic devices are electrically connected to the device connections and are contained in respective cavities when the two wafers are bonded. The bonding can form a hermetic seal for protection of the optoelectronic devices. The structure including the bonded wafers is sawed or cut to produce separate packages or assemblies containing semiconductor optical devices. 
 One specific embodiment of the invention is an assembly including a laser, a sub-mount, and a cap with an integrated optical device. The laser is a device such as a Fabry Perot laser that emits an optical signal. The sub-mount contains electrical traces that are electrically connected to the device on the laser and lead to terminals for connection to external devices. The sub-mount may further contain active circuit elements such as an amplifier. The cap is attached to the sub-mount so as to form a cavity, preferably a hermetically sealed cavity, enclosing the laser. The integrated optical element is in a path of the optical signal from the laser when the cap is attached and does not require a separate alignment process. 
 When the laser emits the optical signal from an edge of the laser, the optical element can be a mirror positioned to reflect the optical signal from an initial direction as emitted from the laser to an output path (e.g., through the sub-mount). The mirror can be formed as a reflective portion of a wall of the cavity. 
 The cap is generally formed from a substrate such as a silicon substrate having a depression. The crystal structure of the substrate can be used to control the orientation of selected walls of the depression/cavity. In particular, a wall corresponding to the mirror formed by a reflective wall or a reflective coating on a portion of the walls can be along a <111> plane of the crystal structure of a silicon substrate. Anisotropic etching can provide a cavity wall with a smooth surface and the desired orientation. 
 Another embodiment of the invention is a method for packaging an optical device. The method generally includes: electrically connecting the optical device to a sub-mount; fabricating a cap that includes an optical element; and bonding the cap to the sub-mount. The optical device is thereby enclosed in a cavity between the sub-mount and the cap, and the optical element in the cap redirects an optical signal that is incident on the optical element from the optical device. 
 Fabricating the cap can be accomplished by creating (e.g., etching) a depression in a substrate and forming the optical element as a mirror corresponding to a reflective area on the walls of the depression. For a silicon substrate, the reflective area can coincide with a <111> plane of a crystal structure of the silicon. 
 Yet another embodiment of the invention is a wafer-level packaging process for lasers containing devices that emit optical signals. The process generally includes: electrically connecting lasers respectively to sub-mount areas of a first wafer; fabricating caps that each include an optical element; and bonding the caps to the first wafer. The lasers are thereby enclosed in respective cavities between the first wafer and the respective caps, and for each laser, the optical element in the corresponding cap is positioned to receive the optical signal from the laser.

" The present invention relates to exercise apparatuses. In more particular the present invention relates to a self-adjusting treadmill having a moveable console and a self-adjusting cushioning assembly. According to one aspect of the present invention, the moveable console and the self-adjusting cushioning assembly of the treadmill automatically adjust based on user parameters when the user steps on the treadmill. The user parameters can be input by the user or automatically detected by the movable console and/or the cushioning mechanism. For example, in one embodiment, when the user stands on the treadmill, the console detects the height of the user and automatically raises or lowers the console to tailor the positioning of the console relative to the height of the user. In another embodiment, when the user steps on the treadmill, the self-adjusting cushioning assembly detects the weight of the user and automatically adjusts the amount of cushioning provided to accommodate the weight of the user. 
 According to one aspect of the present invention, the moveable console includes a height sensor and a console height adjustment mechanism. The height sensor utilizes a light source, such as a laser, infrared (IR), or other source of light to determine the height of the user. Then the console height adjustment mechanism adjusts the height of the console such that the height of the console is tailored to the height of the user. In one embodiment, the console starts in a default position at its uppermost position. When of the user steps on the treadmill, the height sensors are automatically activated and light is emitted from the height sensor. The angle of the light corresponds with a desired placement of the console relative to the height of the user. Where the height sensor detects little or no reflection of light from the user, the console height adjustment mechanism begins to lower the console. The height of the user is detected when the console is lowered to a position in which the light emitted from the height sensor contacts and reflects from the user. Based on the angle of the light emitted from the height sensor, the height of the user can be determined. Once the height of the user is detected the console height adjustment mechanism discontinues further downward movement of the console. This is because the console is in a desired height relative to the sensed height of the user. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the console starts at a default lowest position and is raised until reflection of the light is no longer detected. 
 The cushioning assembly is utilized in connection with a deck of the treadbase of treadmill. The cushioning assembly is adapted to absorb the impact of a user exercising on the treadbase. The cushioning assembly provides a variable amount of cushioning, thus allowing the deck to move a greater or lesser amount when the user is exercising on the treadbase. According to one aspect of the present invention, once the user steps on the treadbase a deflection sensor assembly of the cushioning assembly automatically detects the weight of the user. Based on the sensed weight of the user, the cushioning assembly is automatically adjusted to provide a desired amount of cushioning based on the weight of the user. 
 According to one embodiment of the present invention, a user can select a desired amount of cushioning. In this embodiment, the weight of the user is factored in with the selected amount of cushioning desired and the cushioning assembly is adjusted to provide the desired amount of cushioning based on the weight of the user. 
 These and other objects and features of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, or may be learned by the practice of the invention as set forth hereinafter. 
","1. A cushioned treadmill, comprising: 
treadbase comprising a deck that moves when an exerciser exercises on the treadbase; and 
a self-adjusting cushioning assembly configured to (i) provide cushioning to movement of the deck; and (ii) adjust the amount of cushioning provided to movement of the deck."
" Briefly, the present invention provides a mechanism for receiving new data at an auxiliary device associated with a main computer system and processing that new data within the auxiliary device firmware to take some action. The receipt and processing of the data is independent of whether the main computer system is in a powered-up state (online) or powered-down state (offline). For example, the auxiliary display device may present data from a cache to a user, and the new data may be used to update or augment the data in the cache. This may be done when the main computer system is online and providing other data that may be displayed on the auxiliary device, or when the main computer system is offline and only the cache is available as a subset of the source of the main computer systems' application data. In essence, the auxiliary device receives data from multiple sources, and considers the main computer system as one of those sources. 
 In offline operation, a cache maintains the user application data in association with structured navigational information, whereby the user can navigate among the data, e.g., to see pages of data. When the main CPU, operating system and application programs are online, they build the data cache and transfer it to a medium that can be accessed by the auxiliary device, such as auxiliary storage in the firmware. 
 The cache may be updated with new data that is received by the auxiliary device, without involving the main CPU, operating system and application programs. Because the data is processed in the auxiliary process, the new data is available to the auxiliary device independent of whether the main CPU, operating system and application programs are running. Thus, the new data can supplement the application program data in the online state, add to the tree of cached application program data in the offline state, and/or replace or remove something in the tree. In one implementation, the cache is arranged as a tree structure, whereby the new information could add a new branch if not related to a program that has its data cached, or update cached data if related data is already in the cache. 
 Sources of new data include remote data received by wireless or a wired connection to the firmware. Other examples of data sources include any of the main computer hardware such as a battery controller or network card that continues to operate while the main computer system components (CPU, operating system and the like) are offline. The received data can be processed to update the auxiliary display, or to perform other actions, such as wake the main computer system. 
 Other advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the drawings, in which:
","1. In a computing environment having a main computer system and auxiliary device firmware that operates independently of the main computer system, a method comprising: 
receiving data at the auxiliary device firmware from a source other than the main computer system; and 
processing the data in the auxiliary device firmware to take an action based on the data, such that the action to take is determined independent of whether the main computer system is online."

" The present invention, generally speaking, uses a computer network and a database to provide a hardware-independent, dynamic information system in which the information content is entirely user-controlled. Requests are received from individual users of the computer network to electronically publish information, and input is accepted from the individual users. Entries from the users containing the information to be electronically published are automatically collected, classified and stored in the database in searchable and retrievable form. Entries are made freely accessible on the computer network. In response to user requests, the database is searched and entries are retrieved. Entries are served to users in a hardware-independent page description language. The entries are password protected, allowing users to retrieve and update entries by supplying a correct password. 
 Preferably, the process is entirely automated with any necessary billing being performed by secure, on-line credit card processing. The user making a database entry has complete control of that entry both at the time the entry is made at any time thereafter. The entry, when served to a client, is transformed on-the-fly to the page description language. Where the page description language is HTML and the computer network is the World Wide Web, the entry may function as a “mini” homepage for the user that made the entry. Provision is made for graphics and other kinds of content besides text, taking advantage of the content-rich nature of the Web. 
 Because the user controls both the content of an entry and the manner in which it is classified, the database functions as a directory to allow the Web public to quickly and precisely find current and accurate data about the user, the user's products and services, etc., without requiring the user to have a conventional Web homepage. The user's mini homepage can be included in many different categories, with the user having the flexibility to change the categories or the descriptive content of the page at any time. Preferably, hyperlink services are also provided, by including within the page links to an E-mail address or to one or more other conventional homepages (or other mini homepages). The E-mail address may be a private E-mail address established on the host machine, avoiding the need to obtain a conventional E-mail address. An inexpensive way is therefore provided to set up a Web site with key information that might otherwise be very costly to widely distribute, and to achieve an Internet presence with a minimum of effort and expense.

" The invention relates to a wire cover with a wall for at least partly surrounding wires drawn out from a connector. At least one water-draining hole penetrates the wall in a bent or inclined manner. The bent or inclined water-draining hole enables water in the wire cover to drain. Additionally, the bent or inclined water-draining hole makes it difficult for water to enter the wire cover even if the opening of the water-draining hole is exposed to water. 
 An inner surface of an intermediate portion of the water-draining hole preferably inclines towards an outer side of the wall as it extends from a connection with an inner side of the wall towards a connection with the outer side of the wall. Thus, a minimum width of the water-draining hole can be widened and surface tension will not hinder the draining of water to the outside. 
 At least one rib preferably is provided at least partly around an opening of the water-draining hole to an outer side of the wall. The rib intersects a straight line passing through the water-draining hole and connecting the opening to the outer side of the wall and an opening to an inner of the wall surface. Thus, a range of angles at which water directly enters the inside via the water-draining hole is narrowed, thereby reducing the entrance of water to the inside. 
 The wire cover preferably comprises two housings connected with each other. The two housings preferably are substantially identical. Accordingly, the number of different pieces can be reduced, thus reducing the overall costs. 
 The cover housings preferably are connected with each other by connecting means on the cover housings. The connecting means preferably comprises at least one engaging piece engageable with an engaging projection being preferably rounded. The engaging projection preferably is rounded to reduce the connection friction and thus to improve overall operability.

" The shortcomings of the prior art are overcome and additional advantages are provided through the provision of forming raised portions on the back surface of an integrated circuit in a pattern which corresponds to the hotter areas on the chip. This results in a projecting “mesa” structure on the back side of the chip so that after module assembly, the thickness of the compliant thermally conductive material layer is locally thinner over the “hot spots”. This results in a local reduction of the thermal resistance and hence a reduced temperature of the hot spot on the chip. By local reduction of the paste layer thickness, the allowable global paste layer thickness can be increased, or maintained at a thicker level, which reduces the likelihood of migration of the compliant thermally conductive material and the formation of voids between the chip and the heat sink or cold plate and insures that adequate mechanical compliance is provided between the chip and the heat sink or cold plate. Additionally, if individual pistons are used (as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,647) to better control the compliant thermally conductive material layer thickness over each chip, additional small raised portions at the corners or along the edges of the chip can be formed to insure that the compliant thermally conductive material layer is uniform and that the piston, or heat sink, or cold plate, is not tilted relative to the chip surface. 
 While the preferred embodiment references using mesas over high heat flux areas to reduce the maximum temperature of such areas, typically found in the core areas of processor chips, this same technology may be used to locally lower the temperature of specific functional areas of the chip that have serious repercussions if that function fails even though the area may have just average heat flux densities. For instance, a chip function that is non-redundant or difficult for the server to recover from if it fails could have its circuits cooled lower by placing a mesa over this functional area, improving the reliability of these sensitive circuits. 
 Additional features and advantages are realized through the techniques of the present invention. Other embodiments and aspects of the invention are described in detail herein and are considered a part of the claimed invention. For a better understanding of the invention with advantages and features, refer to the description and to the drawings.

" The present inventors have come to the conclusion that digital rights management will not provide a long-term satisfactory solution to combat illegal distribution of copyright-protected electronic data. The present inventors therefore propose a radical change of approach, namely to allow the distribution of copies of copyright-protected electronic data over the internet providing appropriate copyright payments are made. Further, in order to encourage individuals to pay the copyright payments, the present inventors propose that purchasers of electronic data corresponding to a copyright-protected work should be allowed to sell copies of the purchased electronic data and keep a portion of the sale price for themselves. While it is accepted that such an approach will not eliminate the illegal distribution of electronic versions of copyright-protected works, it is envisaged that it will significantly reduce the level of illegal distribution as previous illegal copiers decide to make money from distributing electronic copies instead. 
 The present inventors have addressed the technical problem of how to implement the approach in a networked electronic trading system. 
 According to an aspect of the invention, an administration server is provided which approves each trade of electronic data corresponding to a copyright-protected work between clients of a networked electronic trading system. 
 Preferably, the administration server also handles the transfer of money between the client buyer and the client seller while ensuring that a royalty payment is made to any registered copyright holders. In this way, the administration server checks both that the client seller has the right to sell the electronic data (which may either be by virtue of being the copyright owner or by having bought a legitimate copy) and that the client buyer has paid the appropriate copyright payment. Preferably, the administration server maintains a database logging each data file storing electronic data for a copyright-protected work with a list of clients who are legitimate owners of the data file. In this way, each time a transaction request is received by the client the administration server is able to check that the client seller is a legitimate owner of the data file identified in the transaction request. 
 Preferably, in addition to paying a copyright payment to the copyright holders out of a sale price for a copy of a data file, the administration server also makes a payment to the original submitter of the data file. In this way, the addition of data files to the networked electronic trading system is encouraged. 
 According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a computing apparatus which offers for sale data files corresponding to copyright-protected works. After receiving a purchase offer from a remote computing apparatus, computing apparatus sends details of the proposed transaction to a remote administration server and awaits a response from the administration server. If the response indicates approval of the transaction then the computing apparatus sends the digital content file to the remote computing apparatus, whereas if the response does not indicate approval of the transaction then the transaction is terminated. 
 According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a computing apparatus which includes a browser for finding data files corresponding copyright-protected works on remote computing apparatuses. The computing apparatus is operable to transmit a purchase request to a remote computing apparatus and a transaction request to a remote administration server. The computing apparatus subsequently awaits receipt of the data file identified in the purchase request and the transaction request from the remote computing apparatus if the transaction is approved by the remote computing apparatus and the remote administration server.

" In its broadest sense, the present invention provides a new and unique apparatus for controlling a search lamp using a wireless transmitter and receiver combination. The transmitter responds to user inputs and provides a wireless digitally encoded modulation signal containing information indicating at least one operation in a set of operations the search lamp is able to perform. The receiver responds to the wireless digitally encoded modulation signal and provides a control signal for controlling the functionality of the search lamp. 
 The functionality of the search lamp may include, for example, moving the search lamp horizontally (e.g. left/right), or vertically (e.g. up/down), or diagonally (e.g. both left/right and up/down), or a horizontal, vertical or diagonal (±45 degrees with both motors run simultaneously) sweep (on/off); X/Y/Z movement (Z when motors run simultaneously); fast/slow sweep (e.g. 50%/100%), or some combination thereof. 
 The transmitter and receiver are programmable to communicate on a fixed frequency using a unique 16 bit digital code setting that provides about 65K different code settings, which may also include a random code setting. 
 The wireless searchlight may also include a voltage regulator for converting a battery voltage in a predetermined range, for example, 9-30 voltages, to a desired battery voltage for operating the searchlight. In particular, the voltage regulator may convert a car battery voltage of about 12 volts to the desired battery voltage, as well as convert a boat battery voltage of about 24 volts to the desired battery voltage. The wireless digitally encoded modulation signal controls the operation of the wireless searchlight using a single channel and may include using a single-frequency shift key (FSK) signal. 
 The transmitter may take the form of a handheld battery power transmitter having a transmitter module for performing the functionality described above. Alternatively, the searchlight may be operated by a controller that may take the form of an embedded personal computer (PC), personal digital assistant (PDA) or other suitable or custom controller that works alone or together with a modified transmitter consistent with that described herein. In this case, the modified transmitter may include a modified transmitter module for performing a reduced version of the functionality defined herein for the aforedescribed battery power handheld transmitter. 
 One advantage of the RF wireless searchlight according to the present invention is that the FM wireless digitally encoded modulation wireless signal, especially at a frequency of 434 Mhz, eliminates interferences otherwise caused if an AM signal was used in relation to noise generated from driver motors moving the search lamp; minimizes FM interferences in relation to signals generated from various other devices otherwise broadcasting typically in a range of 303-390 Mhz, including garage door openers, lighting controls and ceiling fan controls; is a worldwide accepted frequency, for example, in the U.S., Europe and Canada, increasing the potential marketplace for your company's searchlight as a whole. Also FM is resistant to on-vehicle generator and engine electrical noise. It is omnidirectional so there are no line-of-sight issues like those using directional antenna signals. For example, in one known searchlight using an AM-based RF wireless system the AM noise and interference from the driver motor moving the search lamp may actually prevent the stopping of the search lamp once it is set in motion.
","1. A wireless searchlight having a search lamp, comprising: 
a transmitter, responsive to user inputs, for providing a wireless digitally encoded modulation signal containing information indicating at least one operation in a set of operations the search lamp is able to perform; and 
a receiver, responsive to the wireless digitally encoded modulation signal, for providing a control signal for controlling the functionality of the search lamp."

" In some preferred embodiments of the present invention, an apparatus and method are employed for discharging sheets from a starwheel assembly utilized for creating stacks of a desired number of sheets without interrupting the rotation of the starwheel assembly. Some embodiments of the present invention preferably separate sheets such that one separated sheet is allowed to fall and complete a stack and the other separated sheet is supported by a separator to begin a new stack. Preferably, the completed stack is transported away from the starwheel assembly by a conveyor as the new stack supports additional sheets that are discharged from the starwheel assembly. More preferably, the new stack will lower to provide clearance from the starwheel assembly to accumulate the additionally discharged sheets. The apparatus for discharging sheets preferably allows for cyclical repetition of the separation of the sheets, the stacking of the sheets, and the transportation of the stacks such that the continual rotation of the starwheel assembly is not interrupted.

The movable conveyor preferably works in coordination with the first separator finger to receive and support the first stack from the first separator finger. Preferably, the movable conveyor moves toward the starwheel assembly to receive the partially completed first stack from the first separator finger. More preferably, the movable conveyor also moves away from the starwheel assembly axis to accommodate additional discharged sheets on the first stack. Preferably, the first separator finger is re-inserted between a second set of two adjacent sheets that are positioned within the starwheel assembly. The first separator finger can separate a first sheet of the second set of two adjacent sheets from a second sheet of the second set of two adjacent sheets. Also, the first separator finger preferably supports the first sheet of the second set of two adjacent sheets to begin a second stack upon the first separator finger and allows the second sheet of the second set of two adjacent sheets to complete the first stack on the movable conveyor. The movable conveyor carries the completed first stack away from the starwheel assembly while the first separator finger is accumulating intermediate sheets on the second stack.
