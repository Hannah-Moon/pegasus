"It is now beneficial to offer numerous choices to satisfy the many added and extended trimmer uses now offered with these new inventions and technologies.A common upper receiver head, as sold by an original equipment trimmer manufacturer, would incorporate design provisions to snugly allow an easy/comfortable fit for a series of uniquely adaptable and convertible cap attachments such as, mono bump systems, unique molded or shaped flexible line blades with optional cutting swath diameters, as well as other helpful devices that perform different functions beyond just cutting grass.The convertible cap from mono line to line blades, for example, would be designed to fit snugly into the upper receiver head while its finger tabs, in this case, click into open window slots within the receiver head. To remove the cap, the finger tabs of the cap are deflected inward to clear away from the window slots.It would also be most helpful to have an upper head receiver that can utilize common mono line spools and knob components. This would allow interchangeability of existing components (the more common spools and knobs) already in use, to save additional start-up and tooling expense to both manufacturers and users. For example, the receiver head may contain the internal projections needed for the mono line bump advancing mechanism, which remain clear of interference with any other lower cap attachment options.Additionally, a removable arbor adapter may be provided for use with conventional knobs to retain the common line spool. It further enables either a bolt-on cap, or finger tab retention mechanisms to give optional attaching means for other optional and useful cap designs. This arbor adapter device is a part of the convertibility solution, as it enables different cap clamping options. It connects or disconnects directly to or from the driving arbor and can be any shape or length to support the particular needs of the attachment option. When the arbor adapter is used, the finger tab window in the head receiver remains open while offering a view when the internal line spool is installed to visually determine how much line remains.","1. A convertible head system for a trimmer, the trimmer including an upper head secured to an arbor cooperable with a trimmer shaft, the convertible head system comprising:a main convertible cap attachable to the upper head, the main convertible cap including line blade connectors and line blade outlets; anda plurality of line blades connected to the line blade connectors in the main convertible cap and positioned through the line blade outlets."
