 The present invention uses a cascade SVM classifier for face detection. The SVM classifier is trained with a third order polynomial kernel using face and non-face images. To speed up the test-time performance of the SVM, the face detection system and method first reduces the number of kernel evaluations performed for each subimage. In an embodiment, some support vectors are discarded. This results in increased speed, but with some in decrease accuracy. Each support vector has associated with it a coefficient, or alpha (a) value. Support vectors with very small alpha values have only a small affect on the classification of a test image. Consequently, the face detection system and method discards all support vectors with alphas below a certain threshold. This threshold is chosen such that the performance decrease on an independent test set of images is negligible. 
 The face detection system and method also attempts classification of a test image before performing all of the kernel evaluations. Many subimages are not faces. Thus, the SVM classifier attempts to discard non-face images using as few kernel evaluations as possible using a cascade SVM classification. In the first stage, a score is computed for the first two support vectors, and the score is compared to a threshold. If the score is below the threshold value, the subimage is classified as not a face. If the score is above the threshold value, the cascade SVM classification function continues to apply more complicated decision rules, each time doubling the number of kernel evaluations, classifying the image as a non-face (and thus terminating the process) as soon as the test image fails to satisfy one of the decision rules. 
 Finally, if the subimage has satisfied all intermediary decision rules, and has now reached the point at which all support vectors must be considered, the original decision function is applied. Satisfying this final rule, and all intermediary rules, is the only way for a test image to garner a positive (face) classification. 
 Once the face region has been detected, the system performs face recognition. In one embodiment, the face image is converted to grayscale, and normalized by subtracting the mean face image, and dividing each pixel by the standard deviation calculated from faces in the database. The Fisher coordinates are calculated for the test image. During initialization, the Fisher coordinates are calculated for each face image in the database. For each person, the mean of the Fisher coordinates, over all images of that person, is determined. Next, the Fisher coordinates of the test image are compared with the mean Fisher coordinates for each person in the database. The test image is classified as belonging to the person whose mean Fisher coordinates are closest (in Euclidean distance) to the test image.

Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a direct-driven magnetic rotating apparatus suitable for decreasing the cost and size of the apparatus in which the torque transmission efficiency of a magnetic rotating apparatus is increased remarkably to generate higher torque without increasing power consumption and upsizing the apparatus.

The foregoing object can be achieved by including a rotatable rotational shaft; a rotational body including a permanent magnet disposed radially outwards at a prescribed angle around the rim of the outer periphery and fixed to the rotational shaft; and an electromagnet disposed in the vicinity of the outer periphery rim of the rotational body so as to be periodically opposed to the permanent magnet in the vicinity thereof, wherein the permanent magnet is energized by the repulsive force of the electromagnet.

" It is therefore a general object of the invention to supply a continuous or pulsed constant current to a light emitting diode or diodes (LED) load with miniature size, low-cost construction, high efficiency, and superior performance, using a circuit capable of implementation with modern miniature surface mount components. As used herein, an “LED” load includes a laser diode or array of laser diodes. As used herein, “constant current” means essentially constant current, regardless of the actual voltage across the LED load, which can vary. 
 According to the invention, generally, the linear pass element of the current source in FIG. 1 is replaced by a multitude (plurality, n) of staggered-phase switching elements so as to create a controlled current with low ripple and fast rise and fall times if demanded. Because the switching elements are either ON or OFF, there is no dissipation due to a lossy linear control element such as the pass element illustrated in FIG. 1. By using multiple stages, each controlling a portion of the total current (i.e., for a portion of the time during a cycle), the dissipation due to inductor, switching and saturated resistance losses is shared and distributed amongst many parts allowing the use of small cheap surface mount devices. In comparison, Ortiz uses individual large devices with relatively high local dissipation. By staggering and controlling the switching waveform phase of the multiple switching elements, ripple may be greatly reduced even with small inductor values. The polyphase driver of the present invention substantially overcomes the problems associated with the background art discussed hereinabove. 
 According to the invention, a driver supplying a total current to a load comprises a plurality (n) of driver stages (ST). One stage is a master stage. Each driver stage has a switching device (Q) and an inductor (L) connected in series between the switching device and the output of the driver stage. The switching devices are turned ON in sequence with one another, during a cycle time (Tc) that is determined by sensing current through the inductor (L1) in the master stage. When the switching device is turned ON current through the inductor rises, when the inductor current reaches the value of a demanded current the switch is turned OFF, and after the switch is turned OFF the inductor continues to supply (output) current to the load with a current which ramps down. A rectifying device (D) connected between the inductor and the supply line allows current to continue to flow in the inductor and be supplied to the load after the switch is turned off. 
 The switching device in the master stage is turned ON at the beginning of the master cycle time, and the switching devices in the stages other than the master stage are turned ON periodically during the master cycle time. 
 The switching device in the master stage is turned OFF when current through the inductor in the master stage reaches the value of a demanded current, and the switching devices in the stages other than the master stage are turned OFF either: 



 after a time which corresponds to the time (Tp) it took for the value of the demanded current to be reached in the master stage, or 
 when the value of the demanded current is reached in the given stage other than the master stage. 




 Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent in light of the following description thereof.

" One embodiment of includes a method for determining engine torque loss in an internal combustion engine for an engine controlled by a torque control strategy, the method comprising: 



 determining inactive cylinder torque losses of said engine; 
 determining active cylinder torque losses of said engine; and 
 determining an engine torque loss by summing said inactive cylinder torque loss and said active cylinder torque loss. This method can be used to reduce the above-mentioned limitations of the prior art approaches. 




 By determining engine torque loss of inactive cylinder and active cylinders, determination of engine torque loss can be improved improved. 
 For example, by calculating engine torque losses based on active and inactive cylinder losses, strategy complexity may be reduced. In one example, an eight-cylinder engine operating with six active cylinders, i.e., cylinders that combust an air-fuel mixture during a cycle of the respective cylinders, and two deactivated cylinders, i.e., cylinders that do not combust and air-fuel mixture during a cycle of the respective cylinders, may have two sets of calculations. One set of calculations based on active cylinders, and one set of calculations based on inactive cylinders. These same calculations may be used even if the number of active and inactive cylinders changes. Multiple maps for each cylinder and valve mode may be avoided or reduced since losses may be determined, on a per cylinder basis, for both active and inactive cylinders. 
 In an alternative embodiment, by determining a number of active cylinders and number of inactive cylinders, and by determining torque losses in active and inactive cylinders, an improved determination of engine indicated torque may be made. 
 For example, as an engine warms, an eight-cylinder engine may change from eight-cylinder mode to six-cylinder mode, torque losses can be determined in six active cylinders and two inactive cylinders. Therefore, the before-mentioned method can account for differences between active and inactive cylinder torque losses, improving torque determination. 
 On the other hand, if engine torque is determined simply from a number of active cylinders, and if there is a difference between pumping torque in active and inactive cylinders, the difference multiplied by the number of deactivated cylinders may be present in the determined torque amount. Further, a difference between engine friction in active and inactive cylinders will result in a similar difference. 
 The above approach thus has an advantage of providing a better estimate of engine torque losses. This makes possible a better estimate of indicated torque. Thus, transmission shifts, vehicle speed control, cylinder mode control, and idle speed control can be improved. 
 Another advantage can include algorithm simplification and engine controller memory reduction. In one example embodiment, a method estimates cylinder torque losses in both active and inactive cylinders, thus allowing engine torque calculations to be based on the number of active and inactive cylinders. That is, torque maps for every cylinder mode at different speed and load conditions may not be necessary, or can be reduced. Reusing single cylinder calculations for active and inactive cylinders may reduce the controller memory. For example, an eight-cylinder engine operating with six active and two inactive cylinders, cylinder losses are determined individually, six times for active cylinders and twice for inactive cylinders, using one active and one inactive cylinder equation. Respective cylinder losses can then be multiplied by a cylinder mode factor to determine total cylinder losses. 
 The above advantages and other advantages and features will be readily apparent from the following detailed description when taken alone or in connection with the accompanying drawings.

" Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a polygon mirror that can be manufactured at low cost and high productivity, and to provide a polygon mirror in which variations in reflectance is small over a wide range of angles of incident, and a method of manufacturing the same. 
 It is another object of the present invention to provide an optical scanner and electrophotographic equipment of compact size at low cost. 
 The present invention provides a polygon mirror having a plurality of reflecting surfaces for reflecting light, wherein the reflecting surfaces are provided by forming a single-layer film of a substance having an index of refraction of not more than 1.45 on the base member. 
 With the reflecting polygon mirror to be mounted on the optical scanner used in electrophotographic equipment or the like according to the present invention, the polygon mirror can be manufactured at lower cost in comparison with vacuum deposition or anodic oxidation coating by forming a single layer of material having an index of refraction of not more than 1.45, more specifically of amorphous fluorochemical resin that is a substance for a film having a low index of refraction on the reflecting surfaces of the polygon mirror according to the rotating wet film-forming method. 
 With the rotating wet film-forming method for polygon mirrors according to the present invention, variations in film thickness and accidentally occurred irregular film configurations can be prevented by applying the coating liquid only in the area of the polygon mirror of which the distance from the axis of rotation is larger than Ri, where Ri is the shortest distance between the reflecting surface and the axis of rotation for the coating operation, thereby increasing productivity of the polygon mirror and thus decreasing cost of the polygon mirror. 
 Therefore, the optical scanner of the present invention comprising such a polygon mirror and thus the electrophotographic equipment comprising such an optical scanner can be manufactured at low cost. 
 In addition, a constant reflectance is ensured over a wide range of angles of incident by realizing suitable distribution of thickness in the film formed on the reflecting surface of the polygon mirror, which contributes to miniaturization of the optical scanner and enables manufacture of the optical scanner at low cost. Accordingly, the electrophotographic equipment of the present invention comprising such an optical scanner can be miniaturized, and manufactured at low cost. 
 Further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.
","1. A polygon mirror having a plurality of reflecting surfaces for reflecting light, wherein the reflecting surface comprises a single layer film formed of a substance having an index of refraction of 1.45 or below on the base member."
" According to the invention, this problem is solved by a vehicle steering wheel comprising a steering wheel skeleton, a longitudinal axis, at least two components movable relative to each other, and a horn contact switch, which has two electrical contact elements which are brought in contact with each other by means of a relative movement of the two components to each other for a horn actuation. The electrical contact elements are contact wires. 
 Thereby, particular punched parts or special parts are no longer necessary. Rather, only two wires which are provided in any case have to be partially insulated, which are brought into contact with each other through the relative movement of two components of the vehicle steering wheel. The wires forming horn contacts are part of the known horn current circuit. The horn contacts and the horn current circuit are designed so that with a contact of the wires, the horn sounds. 
 The two contact wires, preferably intersecting, viewed in the longitudinal axis, can be provided, uncoupled from each other, on two components, for example one on the underside of the intermediate plate of a gas bag module and the other on the corresponding site on the upper side of the hub of the skeleton. 
 The horn contact switch according to the invention is particularly compact and simple to install when the two contact wires are provided coupled to a common component. For example, the contact wires can be arranged running parallel to each other in a recess, a first contact wire being spaced apart from the second contact wire, which is provided with a U-shaped curvature. For actuation of the horn, the elastic second contact wire is acted upon by force in the curved region and twisted, and also pressed onto the first contact wire, in order to close the horn current circuit After the horn actuation, the second contact wire moves independently into the unactuated initial position. 
 Finally, the contact wires could be arranged in a common switch element with its own housing. This switch element, provided with plugs, can be fastened on installation simply onto the corresponding site, a corresponding coupling ensuring the necessary fixing of the plug, so that no further fixing means are necessary. 
 The common arrangement of the two contact wires to a component involves the further advantage that the elastic contact wire can undertake the function of the restoring spring inside the vehicle steering wheel. Through corresponding dimensioning of the elastic contact wire, it is therefore no longer necessary to provide additional restoring springs for the gas bag module alongside the electric contact element or, if no gas bag is to be provided, for the component (e.g. steering wheel hub cap) which is to be moved by the driver. Thereby, a particularly compact and low overall height can be realized. 
 In order to ensure a good contact between the contact wires on actuation of the horn, on one of the components carrying out the relative movement an actuating element can be provided, which presses one contact wire onto the other on actuation of the horn. This actuating element can be constructed either as an additional component which is to be installed or can be formed in one piece on a component, e.g. by injecting on a plastic part. This is particularly advantageous, because a plastic element is electrically insulating and does not have an effect on the mode of operation of the horn contact.

A vehicle steering wheel with a steering wheel skeleton (10, 110), a longitudinal axis (A), at least two components movable relative to each other, and a horn contact switch, which has two electrical contact elements which are brought in contact with each other by means of a relative movement of said two components to each other for a horn actuation, wherein said electrical contact elements are contact wires (50, 54; 150, 154)."

 It is an objective of the present invention to provide a system and method that can inexpensively and effectively transmits an advertisement (advertising material) and then confirms whether it is rightly broadcasted or not via on-line. 
 To achieve the objective, in the present invention, a server-operating company inserts an ID code, which is composed of letters or numbers, to each advertisement and transmits it to a broadcaster. The broadcaster releases the advertisement with the ID code and then the server-operating company reads out the ID code and produces broadcast review code. The broadcast review code is forwarded to a central server of the server-operating company and the server makes a broadcasting result data based on the broadcast review code. The data is sent to advertisers through Internet and make them possible to monitor commercials in real time. 
 Consequently, the complicated procedure to transmit advertisements and check the broadcasting result is simplified and cost, labor and time are saved. 
 According to the present invention, advertisers' and broadcaster's computers and an ID code reading device are attached to the central server through wire and/or wireless Internet. 
 The server inserts a specific ID code to a certain part of an advertisement in a certain way and the advertisement with the ID code is stored and transmitted to the broadcaster's computer. When the broadcaster releases the advertisement, the ID code is caught in the air by the ID code reading device and analyzed to get the broadcasting results of the advertisement. The results are stored in the server and transferred to the advertiser's computer. In order to read out the ID code released from the radio frequency, the ID code reading device is set up at a place, easy to receive the electric wave, connected with the central server via wire and/or wireless Internet. Once the ID code is decoded, broadcasting date, time and broadcasting length (or seconds) information are processed to a broadcast review code of each broadcast network and the broadcast review code is sent to the server. 
 The central server comprises means for inserting ID code by applying a digital watermarking technology which puts the ID code in the commercial invisibly and inaudibly. 
 Preferably, the ID code contains an advertiser code and a production order code of commercial message for the purpose of classifying the advertiser, advertisement title and content at least. 
 Moreover, the present invention comprises an advertisement information database, which keeps information related with the ID code and commercials with the ID code embedded, and a broadcast program database which carries the information of radio frequency, program title, broadcasting date and time. 
 The ID code reading device is composed of a timer and broadcast review code producers for the broadcast stations. The broadcast review code, later forwarded to the central server, has the information of the ID code, radio frequency of related broadcast network, broadcasting date/time and length (seconds). The server stores the broadcast review code in the broadcast results database. 
 A method of advertisement transmission and broadcast confirmation according to the present invention is made up of four steps. 
 First, advertisers' and broadcasters' computers and an ID code reading device are linked to a central server through wire and/or wireless Internet. Second, a specific ID code is inserted in a certain part of an advertisement in a certain way and the advertisement which contains the ID code is stored in the server and transmitted to the broadcaster's computer. Third, the ID code read out by the ID code reading device, radio frequency of the broadcast station, broadcasting date, time and length (or seconds) information are processed to the broadcast review code of each broadcast network and the broadcast review code is sent to the server. Lastly, broadcasting results of each advertiser is made from comparing and analyzing the broadcast review code of each broadcast network transmitted from the ID code reading device and it is reported to the advertiser's computer in real time. 
 The ID code includes the information of the advertiser and production order of commercial message. The ID code, advertisement information containing an advertiser's name, a product name and an advertisement title and commercial message are organized as a database and stored in the server. 
 The ID code is embedded in a certain part of commercial message in a certain way by digital watermarking technology. 
 Preferably, the central server accumulates all the information of the program title, radio frequency, and a broadcasting date/time to establish a database. The broadcast review codes for the broadcast stations are also stored and organized as a database. 
 The server-operating company receives a certain amount of money from the advertiser for the payment of commercial management and broadcast results review.

 It is a further advantage of the present invention to be able to provide an endocervical curettings receiver which can be positioned near the cervix, and in which, endocervical curettings can be deposited as they are scrapped and/or cut from the cervix area. 
 The advantages set out hereinabove, as well as other objects and goals inherent thereto, are at least partially or fully provided by the endocervical curettings receiver of the present invention, as set out herein below. 
 Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention provides an endocervical curettings receiver comprising an elongate handle having a longitudinal axis; 



 collection means for retaining said endocervical curettings, attached to said handle, at a proximate end of said collection means, wherein said collection means preferably has a concave, spoon shape, and has a truncated end at a distal end of said collection means; and 
 said collection means has a circumferential edge which is smooth to avoid cutting or scrapping of the cervical area. 




 In a further aspect, the present invention also provides a method for obtaining tissue from inside a living body, the method comprising the steps of: 



 inserting a curette having sharp cutting edges inside a body, 
 inserting the collection means of an endocervical curettings receiver inside the body, and positioning said receiver adjacent to said curette, wherein said receiver comprises an elongate handle having a longitudinal axis; collection means for retaining said endocervical curettings, attached to said handle, at a proximate end of said collection means, wherein said collection means preferably has a concave, spoon shape, and has a truncated end at a distal end of said collection means; and said collection means has a circumferential edge which is smooth to avoid cutting or scrapping of the cervical area;

Instead, the receiver is positioned outside of the cervix but in a convenient location for receiving any tissue samples collected from the cervix area using the curette. 
 A second feature of the endocervical curettings receiver of the present invention is that it does not have sharp edges, and therefore, it is not used for scrapping or cutting of tissue samples. It can therefore be placed adjacent to the cervix to collect the tissue samples generated by use of the curette.

 The flow assembly surface may have any profile or topography, such as a raised profile or a recessed profile, which vary the gap between the flow assembly surface and the pad or the workpiece surface at selected locations. The gap between the backside of the polishing pad and the flow assembly surface of the present invention is defined as a variable gap. The varying profile of the surface of the flow assembly and the resulting variable gap between the backside of the pad and the surface of flow assembly provide a well-defined fluid distribution and pressure profile for each zone. Such well-defined fluid distribution and pressure profiles establish well defined polishing rates on the workpiece surface as the polishing pad polishes the workpiece surface. 
 In one embodiment of the present invention, material removal rate from the workpiece surface can be controlled by actively varying the flow assembly surface profile or topography by moving the fluid flow zones with respect to the pad or the workpiece surface, which adjusts the variable gap. In another embodiment, the material removal rate can be controlled by using a flow assembly with a fixed surface profile or topography, which keeps a fixed variable gap which is shaped by the fixed non-planar flow assembly surface and the polishing pad. 
 Accordingly in one aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for polishing a surface of a workpiece includes a carrier configured to hold the workpiece, a showerhead, having a non-planar surface, providing a variable gap between the non-planar surface and the surface of the workpiece and a polishing pad with a polishing side and a back side positioned within the variable gap. The polishing pad is configured to polish the surface of the workpiece with the polishing side when a fluid flow is applied from the non-planar surface to the backside. The fluid flow is applied from a plurality of fluid flow zones formed in the non-planar surface and the fluid flow zones are configured to move to cause a change in the topography of the non-planar surface. A feed back circuit induces a change in the topography of the non-planar surface in response to a change in a removal profile to yield a pre-determined removal profile. 
 In another aspect of the present invention, a method of controlling material removal rate from a workpiece surface is provided. The method includes the steps of holding the workpiece with a carrier, placing the polishing pad into the variable gap provided between a non-planar surface of a showerhead and the workpiece surface; emitting fluid from the non-planar surface of the showerhead onto backside of the pad to establish pressure; establishing relative motion between the pad and the workpiece surface and removing material from the workpiece surface with polishing side of the pad. 
 These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be described below with reference to the associated drawings.

","1. A plastic bag making machine comprising:

" These and other objects of the present invention, which will become apparent hereinafter, are achieved by providing a setting tool of the type described above and the transporting device of which includes means operable by the ignition means for displacing the transporting device from a first position in which the transportation of propellants is prevented, into a second position in which at least partial transportation of the propellants is possible. For operating the displacing means, an ignition displacement of the ignition means, e.g., of a firing pin is used when it is advanced toward a propellant located in the propellant receptacle. This insures that a non-consumed propellant can only then be completely transported up to the propellant receptacle or be at least partially transported toward the propellant receptacle when the ignition means actually strikes, after actuation of the setting tool, the propellant in the propellant receptacle. In case when the ignition means is not displaced, the transportation device is not released so that the same propellant would be enclosed in the propellant receptacle when the setting tool is pressed against a constructional component anew. A non-consumed propellant would not be automatically transported. 
 Advantageously, the transporting device includes transporting spring means for biasing the propellant magazine, e.g., a propellant strip or a cartridge strip, which is received in the guide channel, in a transporting direction. The spring means provides for a technically simple displacement of the propellant magazine. 
 It is further advantageous when the transporting device displacing means includes at least one locking member and a spring for biasing the at least one locking member in a direction toward the guide channel into a position in which transportation of the propellant is blocked. The locking member fixes the magazine or the propellant strip in its position in the guide channel until the locking member is actuated. Advantageously, the locking member cooperates with recesses provided on a side of the propellant strip. The side recesses permit to control in a simple manner the displacement of the propellant strip by the transporting spring means. 
 Advantageously, the transporting device includes at least one actuator for displacing the at least one locking member against a spring-biasing force of the biasing spring from the position in which the transportation of the propellants is blocked, into a position in which the transportation of the propellants becomes possible. Thus, the actuator controls the operation of the locking member. 
 Advantageously, the at least one actuator is displaced by the ignition means from a release position in which displacement of the at least one locking member by the actuator is prevented, into an actuation position in which the displacement of the at least one locking member by the actuator becomes possible. If a further actuator is provided, it can be controlled exclusively by the press-on mechanism of the setting tool. In this way, the transporting device can be controlled or at least partially controlled in a simple manner. It can further be advantageous to provide the ignition means with a control element for displacing the at least one actuator from its release position into its actuation position upon displacement of the ignition means after actuation of the setting tool, from an ignition-ready position of the ignition means into its ignition position. 
 Advantageously, the transporting device displacing means includes two locking members axially offset relative to each other and arranged on opposite sides of the guide channel. With two locking members, the transportation path of the transporting device can be divided in two parts or sections. 
 For effecting a complete transporting sequence for displacing a new propellant in a position coaxial with the propellant receptacle and, optionally for a complete transporting sequence for displacing a burnt-up propellant out of a position coaxial with the propellant receptacle, actuation of both locking members one after another is necessary. 
 Advantageously, the locking members are formed as pawls pivotally supported on respective pivot supports. This permits to reduce the actuation force and the actuation path of the actuators. 
 It is further advantageous when the pivot supports are secured to the guide housing for the ignition means. This permits to obtain a compact structure.

" The present invention achieves technical advantages as an improved radio frequency (RF) emission, or radar, system integrated within a traffic light signaling system adapted to determine, among other things, (1) in advance of an RLR condition, the likely occurrence of an RLR condition, (2) the need to provide a LTW to a driver seeking to make a ULT, and (3) the nature of an approaching flow of object/vehicle targets and dynamically adjust the traffic signals so as to reduce accidents and pavement damage and conserve energy. The present invention is an improved method and apparatus to implement each of the foregoing functionalities, together, in parts or individually. 
 More specifically, the determination of a possible RLR condition can be used to trigger an RLH circuit to hold the cross-traffic red light until it is determined that conditions are safe to provide a green light to cross traffic. The determination of a possible collision between an oncoming vehicle with a vehicle making an ULT can be used to trigger an LTW circuit to warn the driver making the left hand turn of oncoming traffic. The LTW is turned off when the LTW circuit determines that the danger has passed. The determination of the nature of the approaching flow of object/vehicle targets can be used to trigger a GLE circuit that is operable to maintain a green traffic signal until all of the object/vehicle targets in the flow have exited the intersection. In this manner, GLE can dynamically adjust the timing of the traffic signals so as to reduce the chance of accidents and pavement damage. 
 Implementation of the foregoing functionalities requires the use of an RF emission and sensing apparatus, such as radar. Radar transmitters using modulated signals require receivers adapted to sense the reflected signals. The radar transceiver of the present invention uses a Linear Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (“LFM-CW”) RF signal transmission and a multi-stage spectral processing algorithm in the receiver to determine the range, velocity, and return-signal magnitude of the illuminated targets during a very short observation interval. In one embodiment, the target information collected during each observation interval is passed to a high-level tracker (“HLT”) that is capable of tracking the behavior of targets over a longer period of time. The HLT can validate the presence of targets, eliminate invalid observations, and predict the future behavior of targets. The radar/traffic processor collects approaching object/vehicle target information from the HLT and traffic signal state information from the traffic signal system to determine whether to trigger the RLH, GLE or LTW functionalities. An HLT may be integrated in the radar/traffic process. 
 An advantage of the system and method of the present invention is that the modulated radar signal can be used to determine the range and velocity of a number of targets over a large region with high accuracy. Furthermore, the signal processing aspects of the present invention can be used in combination with innovative algorithmic methods for determining whether to trigger the RLH, GLE or LTW functionalities.

" The present invention provides a method of treating ophthalmic biomedical devices including contact lenses, intraocular lenses and ophthalmic implants. This treatment renders the device safe for prolonged contact with ocular tissue and, in the case of contact lenses, comfortable for wear. 
 According to certain embodiments, this invention provides a method of extracting unreacted or incompletely polymerized materials from the device by varying the concentration of a primary solvent, such as carbon dioxide, and a co-solvent, such as isopropanol. During the extraction process, the concentration of the co-solvent is pulsed. By “pulsing”, it is meant that the concentration of the co-solvent begins at a lower first amount and then is increased to a second higher amount. The concentration is then returned to the lower first amount. This is considered to be a single pulse or one cycle. As the amount of the co-solvent is increased, the device expands in dimension, i.e., the diameter and center thickness increase. By reducing the amount of co-solvent, the device shrinks. Multiple pulses are preferred. During each pulse, the device goes through one cycle of expansion and shrinkage. After the extraction, the device is exposed to supercritical primary solvent which serves to dry the device. Following depressurization, the devices are recovered in a dry and unwarped state, and the devices can be further processed easily. As this extraction is done prior to surface treatment, there is no concern that coatings on the devices will be detrimentally affected by a subsequent extraction step; rather, surface treatment can be performed after recovering the dry device. 
 According to further embodiments, a device is extracted while retained in a portion of the mold. The device is released from the mold in which it was formed by the cycle(s) of expansion and shrinkage.

" With an aim to prevent breakage of a cover member of a polymer insulator caused by pecking by a bird, the present invention employs an avian repellent in such a manner that it is carried by the polymer insulator and maintains avian repellency at least during construction of power transmission equipment, thereby inhibiting pecking of the polymer insulator by birds. In other words, an object of the invention is to provide a bird-pecking-preventive polymer insulator which itself exhibits repellency to birds. 
 Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a bird-pecking-preventive polymer insulator. The bird-pecking-preventive polymer insulator according to the present invention includes an insulator body, and a holding metal piece fitted on each end of the insulator body, the insulator body being composed of a core member formed of a reinforced plastic material and a cover member formed of a rubber material and covering the periphery of the core member, wherein the cover member carries an avian repellent. 
 The bird-pecking-preventive polymer insulator according to the present invention may carry an avian repellent which is applied to a surface of the cover member. Alternatively, the polymer insulator may carry an avian repellent which has been kneaded into the rubber material for forming the cover member. Preferably, the polymer insulator carries the avian repellent in an amount of 0.01 wt. % to 20 wt. % based on the entire cover member. 
 The bird-pecking-preventive polymer insulator of the present invention may contain, as the avian repellent, a taste-bud irritant for irritating the taste buds of birds. The taste-bud irritant may be a pungent component or a substance containing a pungent component. Alternatively, the taste-bud irritant may be a bitter component or a substance containing a bitter component. 
 Examples of the substance containing a pungent component include substances derived from Capsicum annuum, Zingiber officinale, Zanthoxyum piperitum, Gomphrena globosa, Polygonum hydropiper, Wasabia japonica, or seeds of Brassica juncea, and pungent components extracted therefrom; e.g., capsaicin, 6-gingerol, α-sanshool, spilanthol, tadeonal, and sinigrin. Examples of the substance containing a bitter component include substances derived from Swertia japonica, Picrasma quassioides, or Sophora flavescens, and bitter components extracted therefrom; e.g., swertiamarin, quassin, and matrine. 
 The bird-pecking-preventive polymer insulator according to the present invention has a cover member serving as a member of the insulator body, the cover member carrying an avian repellent which is applied to a surface of the cover member or which has been kneaded in advance into a rubber material forming the cover member. Therefore, the avian repellent is retained for a considerably long period of time in the sheds of the cover member, which are the most attractive portions to birds and the targets of mischief. Once a bird has pecked the cover member of the bird-pecking-preventive polymer insulator, the bird never pecks the cover member again. Thus, it is considered that, if birds repeatedly gain such experience, the birds will instinctively refuse to peck the cover member of the bird-pecking-preventive polymer insulator. 
 In an experiment in which power transmission equipment having the bird-pecking-preventive polymer insulators has been actually constructed, there have been identified a small number of polymer insulators having few marks in the cover member indicating pecking by birds during a period of constructing power transmission equipment. Most of the polymer insulators have been identified to have no pecking marks.

" In addition, conventional reporting practices often provide no mechanism to allow the radiologist to account for the effective communication of critical report information to the recipient. Frequently, radiologists mistakenly assume that when a report is approved and sent to a referring medical professional, their responsibility ends. To the contrary, however, radiologists are often held accountable for ensuring that proper action is taken on significant findings and are held liable for malpractice when proper action is not taken. 
 Clinicians are the typical end-users of reports from radiologists. A major complaint of such clinicians against radiologists and their reporting practices involves point of service. This problem is illustrated by the following scenario: a patient receives emergency room x-rays for an injury during the night; a radiologist interprets the x-ray images the next morning; and, following transcription, a report is finally delivered to the emergency room physician, but typically only after the patient has been treated and released. Clinicians are now demanding that radiologists issue reports immediately after an imaging study has been performed. 
 Hence, there is a pressing need to provide a reporting system which offers a standardized report format, enables consistency among reports, accounts for effective information flow, provides for quick turnaround of information to the end-user, and supports data mining for public health statistics. In addition, these needs extend beyond the field of radiology, and include other medical fields such as pathology, cardiology, dermatology, as well as other image analysis fields such as satellite imagery and photography.

" Some embodiments of the invention provide 3-terminal molecular electronic devices. Other embodiments of the present invention provide synthesis of new molecules with functionality that allows them to act as nonlinear electronic elements and to chemically attach to silicon-based contact structures. Still other embodiments of the invention provide construction of a nanoparticle-based assembly that can bridge molecular and lithographic length scales. Yet other embodiments of the present invention provide definition of new lithographic approaches that can accommodate molecular installation during processing. 
 Some embodiments of the invention provide a hierarchical assembly methodology to interconnect individual two- and/or three-terminal molecules with other nanoelements (nanoparticles, nanowires, etc.) to form solution-based suspensions of nanoscale assemblies. The nanoassemblies can then undergo chemical-selective alignment and attachment to nanopatterned silicon and/or other surfaces for interconnection and/or measurement. Measurements can focus on characterization of the nanoscale elements self-assembled within the lithographically defined features and/or mapping out of molecular structure property relationships that may govern molecular electronics behaviors. Both of these characterizations may expand the understanding of molecular electronic materials for future device operation. 
 It is known that transistor behavior can be exhibited in single molecules.3,4 These results illustrated the concept of gain, and correlated current-voltage behavior with other properties of the molecule (e.g., a change in spin state). However, embodiments of the present invention can provide gain as the result of a state change within the molecular architecture rather than as the response of a molecule to a change in bias of an underlying (macroscopic) gate electrode. Moreover, an open architecture of some embodiments of the invention can facilitate spectroscopic characterization in addition to correlation of current-voltage behaviors with molecular properties. Finally, embodiments of the invention can bridge the lithographic and molecular length scales by room temperature, orthogonal self-assembly. This strategy can offer the possibility of larger scale integration, rather than making devices in a sequential (one at a time) fashion.

" Various systems and methods described below permit a user's content experience (e.g. music playing experience) to be monitored and for metadata describing this experience to be collected. The metadata is developed by monitoring a number of different parameters that are associated with the user's content experience. This metadata can be dynamically updated as a user experiences media content and then used to impart to the user a personalized experience that is tailored to that specific user. The metadata can be actually associated with the specific media content that a user can play. In some embodiments, a user's metadata and, in some instances the associated media content, can be provided across a wide variety of computing devices on which the user may experience the media content, thus standardizing the user's personalized media experience. As metadata for the user is modified, it can be reconciled across one or more devices so that the user's metadata is generally up-to-date.

" The present invention provides a digitally controlled delay locked loop that can be shut down and rapidly restarted for the purpose of generating phase delays. This development provides a power efficient circuit having rapid lock times and restart times. This is achieved by having a lock time using a binary search. 
 The present invention uses a frequency divider for the purpose of increasing the lock-in range of the phase detector. By increasing the lock-in range of the phase detector, this guarantees that the phase detector will line in at the correct frequency. In the past, frequency divider circuits have been used for power consumption reduction, but not for the purpose of increasing lock-in range of the phase detector. 
 The present invention also uses a binary search in the DAC, which provides a faster lock time than the prior art increment/decrement counters. Additionally, this binary search used in the present invention provides a fixed time for calibration, so that a lock detector circuit is not required. The multiplexing delay chain between lock mode and free running mode saves space, reduces power requirements and allows better performance over known DLL designs. 
 Arbitrarily accurate and absolute delay generation under varying conditions of voltage, process and temperature is possible using current starved DAC-fed calibration. The delay through a chain of basic delay element cells can be calibrated to a known value. A delay locked loop with a phase detector and a digital loop filter can be used to feed a DAC. Once lock has been established, the phase detector can be disengaged, and the loop filter value can be stored indefinitely allowing the calibrated delay chain to be used for other purposes.

" Embodiments of the present invention provide novel search result handling methods and apparatus. Search result handling includes, but is not limited to, reordering search hits, highlighting search hits, or other methods of directing the user to intended results and away from unintended results. 
 In one approach, authority vectors are determined over the graph of Web pages utilizing the graph's hyperlink structure and a coloring process including variations to overcome previous limitations. A bookmark-coloring process (“BCP”) can be used with the graph's hyperlink structure to compute a set of bookmark-coloring vectors (BCVs) comprising BCVs for pages or other network node items. The BCV set can be used for ranking search results by ranking hits based on their BCVs. BCVs can be computed quickly and the BCP can use hyperlink (connectivity) information more efficiently. 
 In many implementations, the BCV set is quite sparse, which is useful in some applications, since it (or a portion thereof) can be fetched into memory faster and occupy less space. A BCV set can be used for personalization of web search results. In a specific embodiment, a BCV set is associated with a subset of important pages, called a hub. When a hub subset of a total web graph is selected, hub specific basis BCVs can be used to compute a general BCV set, and the BVC set can be optimized both in terms of computing and size.

" Broadly the present invention is a method of enhancing the combustion of fuels by adding a combustion catalyst or enhancer to the fuel at an extremely low level depending on the fuel combustion system and method of introducing the catalyst. Preferably the extremely low level is less than 1 part of catalyst or enhancer per 100 million parts of fuel calculated by weight. The catalyst or enhancer may be beneficially added at less than 1 part per 500 million and indeed less than 1 part of catalyst or enhancer per billion parts of fuel calculated on a weight basis. The extremely low level may be a level of less than 1 part of catalyst or enhancer per 50 billion parts of fuel calculated by weight. Most preferably the catalyst or enhancer is present in the fuel in the range of around 1 part of catalyst per 100 billion parts of fuel to around 1 part of catalyst or enhancer per 6 trillion parts of fuel calculated by weight. 
 A suitable catalyst or enhancer may be one or more of polyvinyl chloride, potassium hexachloroplatinate, hydrogen hexachloroplatinate or ammonium nitrate, although any suitable catalyst or enhancer or combination thereof known to a skilled addressee may be used. 
 Combustion may occur in an internal combustion engine, a turbine or in a boiler, jet engine, a furnace or otherwise for a purpose such as providing heat or energy. The combustion catalyst or enhancer may be added to solid fuel, preferably by spraying. Alternatively the combustion catalyst or enhancer may be added to a gaseous fuel. Addition of the combustion catalyst or enhancer may be effected in a gas stream supplying oxygen to a combustion process or in steam added to a turbine. 
 The method may also include altering the ratio of air to fuel in a combustion mixture to increase the amount of air or decrease the amount of fuel.

 dissolving the combustion catalyst in water or other suitable solvent to form a first premix; 
 diluting the first premix by mixing it with a hydrophilic/oleophilic organic compound to form a second premix; 
 diluting the second premix with fuel or other suitable material in one or more dilution steps to provide a desired extremely low level of catalyst. 




 Suitably the hydrophilic/oleophilic organic compound may be isopropyl alcohol or Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (“MTBE”) and/or methylethylketone (MEK) and/or methylisobutylketone (MIBK) and/or butanol. Methanol may also be suitable as can a variety of hydrophilic/oleophilic materials. 
 In a third aspect the invention resides in a method of mixing a combustion catalyst or combustion enhancer with a fuel said method comprising the steps of:

" The present invention resides in an EMI feedthrough filter terminal assembly for an active implantable medical device, which generally comprises a feedthrough capacitor having an aperture therethrough and first and second sets of electrode plates. The second set of electrode plates are conductively coupled to a housing for the active implantable medical device. A terminal pin at least partially extends through the aperture. A conductive insert is disposed within the aperture for conductively coupling the terminal pin and the first set of electrodes, and for mechanically coupling the terminal pin to the feedthrough capacitor. 
 In a particularly preferred embodiment, the insert comprises a resiliently flexible, conductive contact spring which provides the electrical contact between the inside diameter of the feedthrough hole of a ceramic capacitor and the lead wire or terminal pin. More specifically, the electrical contact spring of the present invention makes contact to an inside diameter metallization of the capacitor where it firmly compresses against both this metallization and the feedthrough terminal pin. This makes a very mechanically and electrically robust electrical connection. The insert contact springs can be made of a conductive, resiliently flexible material such as beryllium, beryllium copper, phosphor bronze, Nitinol or the like. 
 Preferably, the contact spring would be plated with a suitable conductive and non-oxidizable material, such as gold, to prevent oxidation or corrosion from occurring in the electrical contact area. Also, preferably, the terminal pin or lead wire is coated with or otherwise comprised of a conductive and non-oxidizable material. 
 It is desirable to have the contact springs be installed as easily as possible during manufacturing. With the contact spring made of beryllium copper, phosphor bronze or similar materials, a tool is used to push downward on the contact spring during the manufacturing process to solidly insert the spring in place between the lead wire and the inside diameter metallization of the feedthrough capacitor. 
 An adhesive may be used to secure the insert within the aperture. For example, the adhesive may comprise an epoxy preform disposed over the insert and cured within the aperture. 
 Memory shape materials, such as nitinol, provide an additional advantage in that it facilitates the assembly method. That is, it can have one shape at one temperature and a completely different shape at a different temperature. The use of nitinol for the contact springs provides unique benefits. For example, the nitinol spring can very loosely fit and slide into the angular space between the feedthrough capacitor inside diameter and the outside diameter of the terminal pin. In this regard, a chilled fixture can be used where a chilled nitinol spring is inserted. When chilled, the nitinol spring fits very loosely and therefore is easily slid in during a manufacturing operation. However, when the assembly is allowed to warm back up to room temperature, the nitinol expands and therefore tightly compresses between the inside diameter metallization of the ceramic feedthrough capacitor and the outside diameter of the terminal pin. When installed in the human body, the nitinol spring further expands, which provides a reliable and mechanical electrical connection. Inside the human body, the nitinol would be exposed to a steady 37° C. 
 In one embodiment, the insert spring comprises a head having a plurality of resiliently flexible legs extending therefrom and insertable into the aperture. The head is configured to rest on the capacitor surrounding the aperture, and/or extending partially into the aperture. The legs are typically non-planar, so as to physically contact the terminal pin and the aperture metallization of the capacitor. The insert may include barbs which permit the insertion of the insert into the aperture, but impede removal of the insert therefrom. 
 The resiliently flexible, conductive contact spring of the present invention may be advantageously used in connection with the manufacture of a broad variety and range of feedthrough terminal subassemblies for active implantable medical devices. For example, the contact spring of the present invention may be advantageously utilized in connection with, among others, (1) internally grounded feedthrough filter capacitors, such as those shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,905,627; (2) capacitors utilized in connection with a ferrite slab, as shown and described in U.S. Patent Application Ser. Nos. 60/473,228 and 60/508,426; as well as in connection with (3) applications involving wire bond pads, such as those shown in U.S. Patent Application No. 60/548,770 (the contents of all of which are incorporated herein).

" The present invention provides such a method for integrating the active behaviors of a ventilator and a nebulizer to optimize ventilation therapy for a patient. The invention further provides such a method for integrating the active behaviors of a ventilator, nebulizer, and a respiratory monitoring device to optimize ventilation therapy for a patient. 
 In a preferred example, the method of integrating the operations of a ventilator and a nebulizer to conduct respiration therapy include the steps of (1) providing a control unit in communication with the ventilator and nebulizer, the control unit arranged to obtain a control value based upon one or more ventilatory control parameters associated with the respiration therapy; (2) operating the ventilator to provide respiration therapy to a patient; and (3) generating a modification signal from the control unit to automatically modify an operating condition of the nebulizer based upon the control value. 
 In a preferred embodiment, an integrated ventilator and a piezo-electric micro-pump nebulizer provides the fundamental ability to control the nebulizer (for example, to turn the nebulizer on or off via an electrical control signal) during various phases of the patient's breath. This fundamental ability provides optimization of aerosolized drug delivery by allowing for automatic adjustment of the synchronization skew and/or period of nebulization within the breath cycle in response to at least one of several parameters obtained by the integrated ventilator and nebulizer. The parameters may include: drug type; information obtained during checkout of the ventilator; patient circuit type; patient circuit volume; patient circuit compliance; patient circuit length; position of nebulizer in patient circuit; inspiratory flow rate of the ventilator; peak inspiratory flow rate of the ventilator; inspiratory volume of the ventilator; bias flow rate of the ventilator; and/or breath control type of the ventilator, e.g. pressure or volume. 
 Thus the integrated method of the present invention allows the intermittent periods of drug delivery from the nebulizer to be optimally matched with the gas delivery to the patient to achieve the most effective delivery for a given drug regimen. 
 In another preferred example, the method of integrating operations of a ventilator and a nebulizer to conduct respiration therapy includes the steps of (1) providing a control unit in communication with the ventilator and the nebulizer; (2) operating the ventilator and nebulizer to provide respiration therapy to a patient, the nebulizer being operated at predetermined dosing periods; and (3) generating a modification signal from the control unit to automatically modify an operating condition of the ventilator based upon the operation of the nebulizer. 
 Integration of the ventilator and the nebulizer further allows for automatic modification of ventilation delivery in response to “dosing periods” (i.e. periods when the nebulizer is being intermittently operated to deliver a drug therapy) of a nebulizer, and more specifically a piezo-electric pump, such that: (1) bias flow is increased or decreased during periods of nebulizer dosing; (2) inspired breath profiles (e.g. pressure or volume) are modified during periods of nebulizer dosing; (3) inspired flow profiles are modified during periods of nebulizer dosing; (4) inspiratory time (including inspiratory pause) is modified during periods of nebulizer dosing; (5) expiratory time (including expiratory pause) is modified during periods of nebulizer dosing; and/or (6) breath rate is modified during periods of nebulizer dosing. 
 In another preferred example, a method of integrating the operations of a ventilator, a nebulizer, and a respiratory monitoring device is provided. The method includes the steps of (1) providing a control unit in communication with the ventilator, the nebulizer, and the respiratory monitoring device, the respiratory monitoring device arranged to obtain a monitoring value based upon one or more monitoring parameters associated with the respiration therapy; (2) operating the ventilator and nebulizer to provide the respiratory therapy to a patient; and (3) generating a modification signal from the control unit to automatically modify an operating condition of the nebulizer based upon the control value. 
 Integration of the ventilator and the nebulizer with monitoring capabilities allows for the initiation, completion or intermediate point of the nebulizer dose delivery to trigger automatic monitoring functions.
